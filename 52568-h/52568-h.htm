<p class='c004'>Giles Saltren caught an express and
whirled down into the west. He had not
taken a ticket for Orleigh Road Station, as
he did not choose to get out there, but at the
nearest town, and there he hired a light trap
in which he was driven to within half a mile
of Chillacot, where he dismissed the vehicle
and walked on.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had resolved what to do. He would
pay a hasty visit to his mother and then go
on to the village, and perhaps call at the
Rectory. He must show himself as much as
possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had hardly left the trap, when, on turning
a corner, he came on Samuel Ceely and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Joan Melhuish walking together, arm in arm.
The sight brought the blood into his pale
face. He was behind the pair, and he was able
to notice the shabbiness of the old man and
the ungainliness of his walk. This man was
his father. To him, the meanest in the
parish—not to his lordship, the highest—must
he look as the author of his being.</p>

<p class='c005'>Joan Melhuish knew nothing of Samuel’s
love affair with Marianne Welsh. She
looked up to and admired the cripple, seeing
him in the light of her girlish fancy, as the
handsome, reckless gamekeeper.</p>

<p class='c005'>Giles’s foot lagged, but he kept his eyes
steadily on the man slouching along before
him. A new duty had fallen on him. He
must provide for the cripple, without allowing
the secret of his relationship to become
known, both for the sake of his mother and
for that of the trusting Joan.</p>

<p class='c005'>Samuel Ceely heard his step and turned
his head, disengaged his arm from the
woman, and extended the mutilated hand towards
the young man.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I say—I say!” began he, with his water-blue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>eyes fixed eagerly on Jingles. “I was
promised a place; Miss Arminell herself said
I should have work, two shillings a day,
sweeping, and now they say she has gone
away and left no directions about me. If
you can put in a word with my lady, or with
my lord, mind that I was promised it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How can you, Samuel, speak of my lord,
when you know he is dead?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My lord is not dead,” answered the old
man sharply. “Master Giles is now my lord.
I know what I am about.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And Samuel would do the work wonderfully
well,” threw in Joan; “of all the beautifulest
things that ever I see, is Samuel’s
sweeping. If they were to give prizes for
that as they do for ploughing, Samuel would
be rich.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should like,” said Giles, “to have some
particulars about my lord’s death.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Tis a terrible job, sure enough,” answered
the woman. “And folks tell strange
tales about it, not half of ’em is true. They’ve
sat on him this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The inquest already?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>“Yes, to be sure. You see he died o’
Saturday, so he was crowned to-day.
Couldn’t do it yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what was the verdict? I have been
to Huxham to-day”—this was the nearest
town.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Samuel can tell you better than I, sir, I
don’t understand these things. But it do
seem a funny thing to crown a man when he
is dead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What was the verdict?” asked Giles of
Samuel.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said the old man, shaking his
head. “It puzzled the jury a bit. Some
said it was an accident, and some that it was
murder; but the worst of it all is, that it will
drive my sweeping at two shillings out of the
heads of my lady and Miss Arminell. They’ll
be so took up wi’ ordering of mourning that
they’ll not think of me—which is a crying
shame. If his lordship could but have lived
another week till I was settled into my
sweeping and victuals, he might have died
and welcome, but to go interfering like
between me and two shillings, is that provoking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>I could swear. Not that I say it was his
lordship’s fault, and I lay no blame on him,
but folks do say, that——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There now, Samuel,” interrupted Joan.
“This is young Mr. Saltren you are speaking
to and you are forgetting.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m not forgetting,” grumbled the old man;
“don’t you be always of a flurrying me.
Why, if I had had my situation as was
promised me, we might have married and
reared a family. I reckon one can do that
on two shillings a day, and broken victuals
from the kitchen. I might take the case into
court and sue Captain Saltren for damages.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hush Samuel,” interposed Joan nervously,
looking at Giles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I aint a-going to be hushed like a baby,”
said Samuel Ceely irritably; “I reckon if I
don’t get my place, we can’t marry, and have
a family, and where will my domestic happiness
be? I tell you, them as chucked his
lordship down the Cleave, chucked my family
as was to be down with him, and if I can’t
bring ’em into court for murdering his lordship,
I can for murdering my family, of as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>healthy and red-cheeked children as might
have been—all gone,” said the old man
grimly. “All, head over heels down the
Cleave, along of Lord Lamerton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How can you talk so?” said Joan,
reproachfully. “You know you have no
children.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I might have had—a dozen of ’em—seven
girls and five boys, and I’d got the names
for them all in my head. I might have had
if I’d got the sweeping and the broken
victuals as I was promised. What’s the
difference in wickedness, I’d like to know?”
asked the old man sententiously, and figuring
out his proposition on Saltren’s coat with his
crooked fingers. “What’s the odds in
wickedness, chucking over a horrible precipice
a dozen sweet and innocent children as
is, or as is to be, my family was as certain as
new potatoes in June, and now all gone,
chucked down the Cleave. It is wickedness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is that you hinted about Captain
Saltren?” asked Giles gravely.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I say nothing,” answered old Samuel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>sourly. “I don’t talk—I leave that to the
woman.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It does seem a pity,” said Joan. “Samuel
would have been so useful. He might have
gone about the park picking up the sandwich-papers
and the corks and bottles, after the
public.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But,” said the young man, “I really wish
to know what the talk is about in which my
father’s name is introduced.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sir, sir! folk’s tongues go like the clappers
in the fields to drive away the blackbirds. A
very little wind makes ’em rattle wonderfully.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But what have they said?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well”—Joan hesitated. She was a
woman of delicate feeling. “Well, sir, you
must not think there is anything in it.
Tongues cannot rest, and what they say to-day
they unsay to-morrow. Some think that
as the captain was so bitter against his lordship,
and denounced him as ordained to
destruction, that he may have had a helping
hand in his death. But, sir, the captain did
not speak so strong as Mr. Welsh, and
nobody says that Mr. Welsh laid a finger on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>him. Why should they try to fix it on
your father and not on your uncle? But, sir,
there is no call to fix it on any one. I might
walk over the edge of the Cleave. If a man
goes over the brink, I reckon he needs no
help to make him go to the bottom.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The jury couldn’t agree, Joan,” said
Samuel. “Two of ’em wanted to bring in
wilful murder against the captain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So they did against his lordship in the
case of Arkie Tubb. But that was nonsense.
His lordship wasn’t there. And this is nonsense,
just the same.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But the captain was nigh. Mr. Macduff
saw him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, and he might have seen me, and he
did see me a little while afore, as I was coming
from Court with some baccy money for
you, Samuel. That don’t follow that I killed
his lordship. Mr. Macduff see’d also Farmer
Yole’s old grey mare. Be you a going accusing
of that old mare of having had a hoof in
his lordship’s death?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where did Mr. Macduff see my father?”
asked the young man.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“On the down. But he didn’t see him
speak to his lordship, and he couldn’t tell to
half an hour or three-quarters when it was.
So the crowner discharged the jury, just as
he did in the case of Arkie, and he got together
another, and they found that his lordship
had done it accidental.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“For all that,” growled Samuel, “folks
will always say that the captain helped him
over, as he was so set against him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then,” said Joan, “it is a shame and a
sin if they do. It is one thing to talk against
a person, and another thing to lift a hand
against him. I’ve said hard things of you,
scores of times; I’ve said you never ought to
have taken the game and sent it off by the
mail-cart when you was keeper, and that you
couldn’t have blown off your hand if you’d
not gone poaching, nor put out your hip if
you’d been sober—I’ve said them cruel things
scores o’ times, but never laid a finger on you
to hurt you. I couldn’t do it—as you know
very well.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She cast an affectionate glance at the
cripple; then she went on, “Lord! I forgive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and excuse all the frolics of your youth; and
folks always says things rougher than they
mean them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Instead of going on to Chillacot, as he had
at first intended, Giles now resolved on following
the road to the village, and returning
home later. He must lose no time in showing
himself. He trusted that in the excitement
caused by the death of Lord Lamerton
no questions would be raised about Arminell,
and any little suspicions which might have
been awakened by her sudden departure
would be allayed.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was not altogether easy about his father,
nor satisfied with Joan’s justification of him.
That the jury had returned a verdict of
accidental death was a relief to his mind, but
it made him uncomfortable to think that suspicion
against his father should be entertained.
Giles had little or no knowledge of his father’s
new craze. He knew that the captain was a
fanatic who went heart and soul with whatever
commended itself to his reason or
prejudice. At one time he took up hotly the
subject of vegetarianism, then he became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>infatuated with Anglo-Israelism, then he believed
vehemently in a quack syrup he saw
advertised in a Christian paper, warranted to
cure all disorder; after that he became
possessed with the teetotal mania, and
attributed all the evils in the world, war,
plagues, earthquakes, popery, and foot-and-mouth
disease to the use of alcohol. Recently
he had combined his religious vagaries with
political theories, and had made a strange
stir-about of both. His trouble at losing his
situation as captain of the manganese mine,
and his irritation against the railway company
for wanting Chillacot had combined to work
him into a condition of unusual excitability.
Giles had heard that his father had seen a
vision, but of what sort he had not inquired,
because he was entirely out of sympathy with the
spiritual exaltations and fancies of his father.</p>

<p class='c005'>The village of Orleigh was not what is
commonly termed a “church town,” that is to
say, it was not clustered about the church,
which stood in the park, near the mansion of
the Ingletts. In ancient days, when the
population was sparse, the priest drew his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>largest congregation from the manor house,
and therein he lived as chaplain and tutor;
consequently in many places we find the parish
church situated close to the manor house, and
away from the village which had grown up
later. It was so at Orleigh. The village
consisted of a green, with an old tree in the
midst, an ale-house, the Lamerton Arms, a
combined general and grocery store, which
was also post office, a blacksmith’s forge, and
half-a-dozen picturesque cottages white-washed,
with red windows and thatched roofs.
Most of these houses had flower gardens
before their doors, encouraged thereto by an
annual Floricultural Society which gave prizes
to those villagers who had the neatest, most
cheerful and varied gardens.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jingles found knots of men standing about
the green, some were coming out of, others
about to enter the public-house door; another
knot clustered about the forge. Women were
not wanting, to throw in words.</p>

<p class='c005'>The dusk of evening had settled in, so that
at first none noticed the approach of the
young man. He came, not by the road, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>across by the blacksmith’s garden, where a
short cut saved a round. Thus he was in the
midst of the men before they were aware that
he was near.</p>

<p class='c005'>He could not catch all that was being said,
but he heard that the death of Lord Lamerton
occupied their minds and exercised their
tongues. His father’s name was also freely
bandied about.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I say,” exclaimed the village tailor, in a
voice like that of a corncrake, “I say that
Cap’n Saltren did it. What do you consider
the reason why the coroner discharged the
jury and called another? I know, if you do
not. You don’t perhaps happen to know,
but I do, that Marianne Saltren’s aunt, old
Betsy Welsh, washes for the coroner. Nothing
more likely, were he to allow a verdict
against the captain, than that his shirt-fronts
would come home iron-moulded. Don’t tell
me there was no evidence. Evidence is
always to be had if looked for. Evidence is
like snail’s horns, thrust forth or drawn in, according
to circumstances. If the coroner had
wanted evidence, he could have had it. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>he was thinking of his shirt-front, and he,
maybe, going out to a dinner-party. It is
easy done, boil an old nail along with the
clothes, and pounds’ worth of linen is spoiled.
I don’t blame him,” concluded the tailor sententiously.
“Human nature is human nature.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And,” shouted a miner, “facts is facts”—but
he pronounced them <i>fax</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lord Lamerton,” said a second miner,
“wanted to make a new road, and carry it to
Chillacot. The cap’n didn’t like it, he didn’t
want to have a station there. He was set
against his lordship on that account, for his
lordship was a director. If you can prove to
me that his lordship wasn’t a director, then I
shall admit he may have come by his death
naturally. I say naught against his lordship
for not wanting to have his house undermined,
but I do say that the cap’n acted unreasonably
and wrongly in not letting the
company have Chillacot for the station. If
he’d have done that, his lordship would have
found us work on the road.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, Gloyne,” called the other miner,

<p class='c004'>“Come here,” shouted the blacksmith, who
was outside his shop, and still wore his apron,
and the smut and rust on his hands and face.
“Come here, Master Jingles. You’ve come
into the midst of us, and we want to know
something from you. Where is your father?
We’ve seen nothing of him since Friday. If
he has not been at mischief, why don’t he
come forward like a man? Why don’t your
father show his face? He ain’t a tortoise,
privileged to draw it in, or a hedgehog, at
liberty to coil it up. Where is he? He is
not at home. If he is hiding, what is he hiding
from unless he be guilty?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He may have gone after work,” said
young Saltren.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I heard him say,” said the shoemaker,
“that his lordship was doomed to destruction.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know he said it,” answered the blacksmith,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“and I ask, is a man like to make a
prophecy and not try to make what he said
come to pass?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Human nature is human nature,” threw
in the tailor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And fax is fax,” added the miner.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then,” pursued the blacksmith, “let us
look at things as they affect us. His lordship
has kept about twenty-three horses—hunters,
cobs, ponies and carriage horses—and each
has four hoofs, and all wants shoeing once a
month, and some every fortnight. That
brings me in a good part of my living. Very
well. I ask all who hear me, is his lordship
like to keep such a stud now he is dead? Is
he like to want hunters? I grant you, for the
sake of argument, that the young lady and
young gentleman will have their cobs and
ponies, but will there be anything like as
many horses kept as there have been? No,
in reason there cannot be. So you may consider
what a loss to me is the death of his
lordship. My worst personal enemy couldn’t
have hit me harder than when he knocked
Lord Lamerton over the Cleave. He as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>much as knocked a dozen or fourteen horses
over with him, each with four hoofs at sixpence
a shoe, and shod, let us say, eighteen
times in the year.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are right,” put in the tailor, “landed
property is tied up, and his lordship’s property
is tied up—tied up and sealed like mail
bags—till the young lord comes of age,
which will not be for eleven years. So
Blatchford,”—addressing the blacksmith—“you
must multiply your horses by
eleven.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That makes,” said the smith, working
out the sum in chalk on the shutter of the
shop, “say fourteen horses eighteen times—two
hundred and two—and by four—and
again by eleven—and halved because of sixpences,
that makes five hundred and fifty-four
pounds; then there were odd jobs, but them
I won’t reckon. Whoever chucked Lord
Lamerton down the Cleave chucked five
hundred and fifty-four pounds of as honestly-earned
money as ever was got, belonging to
me, down along with him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fax is fax,” said the miner.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“And human nature is human nature to
feel it,” added the tailor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’s another thing to be considered,”
said a game-keeper. “In the proper sporting
season, my lord had down scores of
gentlemen to shoot his covers, and that
brought me a good many sovereigns and half-sovs.
Now, I’d like to know, with the family
in mourning, and the young lord not able to
handle a gun, will there be a house full of
gentlemen? It wouldn’t be decent. And
that means the loss of twenty pounds to me—if
one penny.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nor is that all,” said the tailor, “you’ll
have Macduff to keep an eye on you, not my
lord. There’ll be no more chucking of
hampers into the goods train as it passes
Copley Wood, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The keeper made no other reply than a
growl, and drew back.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is my daughter Jane, scullery-maid
at the Park,” said the shoe-maker, “learning
to be a cook. If her ladyship shuts up the
house, and leaves the place, what will become
of Jane? It isn’t the place I grieve for, nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the loss of learning, for places ask to be filled
now and any one will be taken as cook, if
she can do no more than boil water—but it is
the perquisites. My wife was uncommon
fond of jellies and sweets of all sorts, and I
don’t suppose these are to be picked off
hedges, when the house is empty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here comes Farmer Labett,” exclaimed
the tailor. “I say, Mr. Labett, did not his
lordship let off five-and-twenty per cent. from
his rents last fall?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is no concern of yours,” replied the
farmer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But it does concern you,” retorted the
tailor, “for now that his lordship is dead, the
property is tied up and put in the hands of
trustees, and trustees can’t remit rents. If
they were to do so, the young lord, when he
comes of age, might be down on them and
make them refund out of their own pockets.
So that away over the rocks, down the
Cleave, went twenty-five per cent. abatement
when his lordship fell, or was helped
over.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah!” groaned the shoemaker, “and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>them jellies, and blanc-mange, and custards
was chucked down along of him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And now,” said another, “Macduff will
have the rule. Afore, if we didn’t like what
Macduff ordained, we could go direct to his
lordship, but now there will be no one above
Macduff but trustees, and trustees won’t
meddle. That will be a pretty state of things,
and his wife to ride in a victoria, too.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then a woman called Tregose pushed her
way through the throng, and with loud voice
expressed her views.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t see what occasion you men have
to grumble. Don’t y’ see that the family will
have to go into mourning, and so get rid of
their colours, and we shall get them. There’s
Miss Arminell’s terra-cotta I’ve had my eye
on for my Louisa, but I never reckoned on
having it so soon. There never was a wind
blowed,” argued Mrs. Tregose, “that was an
unmixed evil, and didn’t blow somebody
good. If this here wind have blowed fourteen
horses, and jellies and twenty-five per cent.
and the keeper’s tips over the Cleave—it ha’
blowed a terra-cotta gown on to my Louisa.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“But,” argued the tailor in his strident
voice, “supposing, in consequence of the
death, that her ladyship and the young lady
and the little lord give up living here, and go
for education to London or abroad, where
will you be, Mrs. Tregose, for their cast
gowns? Your Louisa ain’t going to wear
that terra-cotta for eleven years, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’s something in that,” assented the
woman, and her mouth fell. “Yes,” she said,
after a pause for consideration, “who can tell
how many beautiful dresses and bonnets and
mantles have gone over the Cleave along
with the blanc-mange, and the horses and the
five-and-twenty per cent.? I’m uncommon
sorry now his lordship is dead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve been credibly informed,” said the
tailor, “that his lordship laid claim to Chillacot,
and said that because old Gaffer Saltren
squatted there, that did not constitute a title.
Does it give a rook a title to a Scotch fir
because he builds a nest on it? Can the
rook dispose of the timber? Can it refuse
to allow the tree to be cut down and sawn
up, for and because he have sat on the top of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>it? I’ve an old brood sow in my stye.
Does the stye belong to the sow or to me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fax is fax,” assented the miner.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And,” urged the blacksmith, “if his
lordship wanted to get the land back, why
not? If I lend my ladder to Farmer Eggins,
haven’t I a right to reclaim it? His lordship
asked for the land back, not because he
wanted it for himself, but in the interest of
the public, to give us a station nigh at hand,
instead of forcing us to walk three and a half
or four miles, and sweat terrible on a summer’s
day. And his lordship intended to run a new
road to Chillacot, where the station was to
be, and so find work for hands out of employ,
and he said it would cost him a thousand
pounds. And now, there is the new road
and all it would have cost as good as thrown
over the Cleave along with his lordship.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The captain—he did it,” shouted the
blacksmith.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fax speak—they are fax. Skin me alive,
if they baint,” said the miner.</p>

<p class='c005'>Giles Inglett Saltren had heard enough.
He raised his voice and said, “Mr. Blatchford,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and the rest of you—some insinuate,
others openly assert that my father has been
guilty of an odious crime, that he has had a
hand in the death of Lord Lamerton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He was interrupted by shouts of “He has,
he has! We know it!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How do you know it? You only
suppose it. You have no grounds absolutely,
no grounds for basing such a supposition.
The coroner, as yourselves admit, refused to
listen to the charge.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A voice: “He was afraid of having his
shirt-fronts moulded.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here, again, you bring an accusation as
unfounded as it is absurd, against an honourable
man and a Crown official. If you had
been able to produce a particle of evidence
against my father, a particle of evidence to
show that what you imagine is not as hollow
as a dream, the coroner would have hearkened
and acted. Are you aware that this bandying
of accusations is an indictable offence? My
father has not hurt you in any way.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This elicited a chorus of cries.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He has spoiled my shoeing.” “He has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>prevented the making of the road.” “My
wife will never have blanc-mange again.”
And Samuel Ceely, now arrived on the scene,
in whispering voice added, “All my beautiful
darlings—twelve of them, as healthy as apples,
and took their vaccination well—all gone
down the Cleave.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It really seemed as if the happiness, the
hopes, the prosperity of all Orleigh, had gone
over the edge of the cliff with his lordship.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I repeat it,” exclaimed the young man,
waxing warm; “I repeat it, my father never
did you an injury. You are now charging
him with hurting you, because you suffer
through his lordship’s death, and you are
eager to find some one on whom to cast
blame. As for any real sorrow and sympathy,
you have none; wrapped up in your petty
and selfish ends.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A voice: “Fax is fax—he did kill Lord
Lamerton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The tailor: “Human nature is human nature,
and nobody can deny he prophesied my lord’s
death.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I dare you to charge my father with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>crime,” cried young Saltren. “I warn you.
I have laid by a little money, and I will spend
it in prosecuting the man who does.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We all do. Prosecute the parish,” rose
in a general shout.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My father is incapable of the crime.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We have no quarrel with you, young
Jingles,” roared a miner. “Our contention is
with the captain. Mates, what do y’ say?
Shall we pay him a visit?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aye—aye!” from all sides. “Let us
show him our minds.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A boisterous voice exclaimed: “We’ll serve
him out for taking the bread out of our mouths.
We’ll tumble his house about his ears. He
sha’n’t stand in our light any more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And another called, “If you want to prosecute
us, we’ll provide you with occasion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then a stone was flung, which struck Jingles
on the head and knocked him down.</p>

<p class='c005'>For a few minutes the young man was unconscious,
or rather confused, he never quite
lost his senses. The women clustered about
him, and Mrs. Tregose threw water in his
face.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>He speedily gathered his faculties together,
and stood up, rather angry than hurt, to see
that nearly all the men had departed. The
act of violence, instead of quelling the excitement,
had stirred it to greater heat; and the
body of the men, the miners, labourers, the
blacksmith, tailor, and shoemaker, their sons
and apprentices, went off in a shouting gesticulating
rabble in the direction of the Cleave,
not of Chillacot, but of the down overhanging
it.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a moment the latent savage, suppressed
in those orderly men, was awake and asserting
itself. Mr. Welsh had spoken the truth
when he told Jingles that the destructive
passion was to be found in all; it was aroused
now. The blacksmith, the tailor, the shoemaker,
the labourers, had in all their several
ways been working constructively all their life,
one to make shoes and harrows, one to shape
trousers and waistcoats, one to put together
boots, others to build, and plant, and stack,
and roof, and now, all at once, an appeal came
to the suppressed barbarian in each, the
chained madman in the asylum, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>destructive faculty was loose and rioting in its
freedom.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thomasine Kite stood before the young
man. “Now then,” she said half mockingly,
“if you want to save your mother out of the
house before the roof is broke in, you must
make haste. Come along with me.”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XXXIX.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>THE FLOW OF THE TIDE.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Captain Saltren returned at night to sleep
at Chillacot, but he wandered during the day
in the woods, with his Bible in his pocket or
in his hand, now reading how Gideon was
raised up to deliver Israel from Midian, and
Samson was set apart from his mother’s
womb to smite the Philistines, then sitting at
the edge of the quarry brooding over his
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was not able to fix his mind for long
on anything, and he found that the Scripture
only interested and arrested his attention so
far as it touched on analogous trains of ideas.
For the first time in his life a chilling sense
of doubt, a cold suspicion of error stole over
his heart. When this was the case he was
for a moment in agony, his nerves tingled,
his throat contracted, and a clammy sweat
broke out over his face. The fit passed, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>he was again confident, and in his confidence
strong. He raised his voice and intoned a
hymn, then became frightened at the sound,
and stopped in the midst of a stanza.</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently he recalled his wife’s deceptions
and how his heart had foamed and leaped at
the thought of the wrong done her and himself,
and how he had nourished a deadly
hatred against Lord Lamerton on that
account. Now he knew that there had been
no occasion for this hatred. What had he
done to his lordship? Had he really with his
hand thrust him over the precipice, or had
the nobleman fallen in stepping back to avoid
the blow. Either way the guilt, if guilt there
were, rested on Saltren’s head; but the
captain would not listen to the ever welling-up
suggestion that there was guilt. It was
not he who had killed his lordship, it was the
hand of God that had slain him, because the
hand of human justice had failed to reach
him. The captain entertained little or no
personal fear—he was ready, if it were the
will of heaven, to appear before magistrates
and juries; before them he would testify as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the apostles had testified. If it were the will
of heaven that he should die on the gallows,
he was ready to ascend the scaffold, sure of
receiving the crown of glory; perhaps the
world was not ripe to receive his mission.</p>

<p class='c005'>When that wave of horror swept over him,
no fear of the consequences of his act helped
to chill the wave; his only horrible apprehension
was lest he should have made a mistake.
This it was that lowered his pulsation,
turned his lips blue, and made a cloud come
between him and the landscape. He fought
against the doubt, battled with it as against a
temptation of the Evil One, but as often as
he overcame it, it returned. The discovery
that he had been deceived by Marianne into
believing that Lord Lamerton had injured
him, was the little rift in his hitherto unbroken
all-enveloping faith; but even now he had no
doubt about the vision, but only as to its purport.
That he had seen and heard all that
he professed to have seen and heard—that he
believed still, but he feared and quaked with
apprehension lest he should have misread his
revelation.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>It is not easy, rather is it impossible, for a
man of education, surrounded as he has been
from infancy by ten thousand influences to
which the inferior classes are not subjected,
to understand the self-delusion of such a
man.</p>

<p class='c005'>The critical, sceptical spirit is developed in
this century among the cultured classes at an
early age, and the child of the present day
begins with a <i>Dubito</i> not with a <i>Credo</i>.
Where there is no conviction there can be no
enthusiasm, for enthusiasm is the flame that
dances about the glowing coals of belief; and
where no fire is, there can be no flame. We
allow of any amount of professions, but not of
conviction. Zeal is as much a mark of bad
breeding as a hoarse guffaw.</p>

<p class='c005'>Enthusiasms are only endurable when
affectations, to be put on and put off at
pleasure; to be trifled with, not to be possessed
by. This is an age of toleration; we
tolerate everything but what is earnest, and
we lavish our adulation on the pretence, not
the reality of sincerity. For we know that a
genuine enthusiasm is unsuitable for social
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>intercourse; he who is carried away by it is
carried beyond the limits of that toleration
which allows a little of everything, but exclusiveness
to none. He who harbours a
belief is not suffered to obtrude it; if he be a
teetotaller he must hide his blue ribbon; if a
Home Ruler, must joke over his shamrock;
if a Quaker; must dress in colours; if a
Catholic, eat meat on Good Friday. The
apostle expressed his desire to be all things to
all men; we have made universal what was
then a possibility only to one, we are all things
to all men, only sincere neither to ourselves
nor to any one. We are like children’s penny
watches that mark any hour the wearers
desire, not chronometers that fix the time for
all. How can we be chronometers when we
have no main springs, or if we had them, wilfully
break them.</p>

<p class='c005'>We regard all enthusiasms as forms of
fever, and quarantine those infected by them;
we watch ourselves against them, we are uneasy
when the symptoms appear among our
children. At the least quickening of the
pulse and kindling of the eye we fly to our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>medicine chests for a spiritual narcotic or a
sceptical lowering draught.</p>

<p class='c005'>The new method of dealing with fevers is
to plunge the patient in cold water, the reverse
of the old method, which was to bring out the
heat; and we apply this improved system
to our spiritual fevers, to all these mental
attacks bred of convictions. We subdue them
with the douche and ice, and the wet blanket.
When the priests of Baal invoked their god
on Mount Carmel, they leaped upon the altar,
and cut themselves with knives; but Elijah
looked on with a supercilious smile, and invited
those who followed him to pour buckets
of water over his sacrifice; and with what
pity, what contempt we regard all such as are
possessed with the divine fury, and are ready
to suffer and make themselves ridiculous for
their god; how we water our oblations, and
make sure that the sticks on our altar are
green and incombustible; how, if a little
spark appears, or a spiral of smoke arises, we
turn on hydrants, and our friends rush to our
aid with the buckets, and we do not breathe
freely till spark and smoke are subdued.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>But then, because altars are erected for
burnt sacrifices, and a burnt sacrifice is unsavoury,
expensive, and unfashionable, we
thrust a little coloured tin-foil in among the
wet sticks, and protest how natural, how like
real fire it looks, and we prostrate ourselves
before it in mock homage.</p>

<p class='c005'>No dread of enthusiasm, no shrinking from
conviction, is found among the uneducated,
and the semi-educated. Among them enthusiasm
is the token of the divine afflatus, as
madness is regarded among savages. They
respect it, they bring fuel to feed it, they allow
it to burst into extravagance, to riot over
reason, and to consume every particle of
common sense. The corrective, judicial
faculty, the balance wheel is deficient; the
strength, not the quality of a conviction gives
it its command to the respect and adhesion of
the many. If I were to break out of Bedlam
with the one fixed idea in me that I had eyes
at the ends of my ten toes, wherewith I saw
everything that went on in the world, and
with my big toes saw what was to be in the
future; and if I went up and down England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>preaching this and declaring what I saw with
my toes, and continued preaching it with the
fire of perfect sincerity for a twelvemonth, I
would shake the hold of the Established
Church on the hearts of the people, and make
the work of the Liberation Society easy.
Half England would form the Church of the
seeing toes, but in that Church I would not
number any of the cultured.</p>

<p class='c005'>As for us, we get over our enthusiasms
early, as we cut our teeth, and we lose them
as rapidly. Primeval man wore his teeth till
he died, so do savages of the present day;
but the very milk teeth of our infants decay.
We are so familiar with the fact that we
assume that all good sets of teeth are false,
that if we keep here and there a fang in our
jaws, it is carious, and only preserved as a
peg to which to wire our sham molars and
front teeth. It is so unusual to find any one
with a real set, that we look on such a person
with suspicion as having in him a stain of
barbarous blood.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is obvious that this defect of real teeth
in our jaws has its advantages. It allows us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>to change our teeth when we find those we
have hitherto worn inconvenient or out of
fashion.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is the same with our convictions, we lose
them early, all the inside disappears, leaving
but the exterior enamel, and that breaks away
finally.</p>

<p class='c005'>But then, we do not open our mouths to
our friends and in society, exposing our deficiencies.
We replace what is lost by what
looks well, and hold them in position by the
fragments of early belief that still project;
and when these artificial articles prove irksome
we change them. This is how it is that,
for instance, in politics, a man may profess
to day one thing, and something quite different
to-morrow. No one is shocked, every
one understands that this exhibition to-day is
unreal, and that to-morrow also unreal.</p>

<p class='c005'>But, together with the advantage afforded
by this power of altering our sets, there is a
disadvantage which must not be left unnoticed,
which is that the biting and holding
power in them is not equal to that possessed
by the natural articles.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Patience Kite came upon the captain as he
stood in a dream, Bible in hand, but not reading,
meditating, and looking far away, yet
seeing nothing. She roused him with a hand
on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you know what they are about?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They! Who?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All the parish—the men; the miners out
of work, the day-labourers, the tradesmen, all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren shook his head; he desired to be
left alone to his thoughts, his prayers, his
Bible reading.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They are destroying your house,” said
Patience, shaking him, to rouse him, as she
would have shaken a sleeper.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My house? Chillacot?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, they are; they are breaking up the
rock on the Cleave; and throwing it down
on your roof, and smashing it in.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My house! Chillacot?” He was still
absent in mind. He could not at once withdraw
his thoughts from where they had
strayed to matters so closely concerning himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is true; Tamsine came running to me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to tell me about it. Your son managed to
get into the house and bring his mother out,
and Marianne is like one in a fit, she cannot
speak—<i>that</i>, if you wish it, is a miracle. The
men have set picks and crowbars to work to
tumble the stones down on your house and
garden, and bury them. Slates and windows
are smashed already, and the shrubs broken
down in your garden.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My house!—why?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why? Because you won’t let the railway
come along there, and the parish is
angry, and thinks the station will be set
further from the village. The fellows say
you, with your obstinacy, are standing in the
way of improvement, and driving trade and
money out of the place.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Stephen Saltren looked at Mrs. Kite with
dazed eyes. He could not receive all she said,
but he allowed her to lead him through the
woods in the direction of Chillacot. He came
out with her at the spot where he had stood
before and looked on whilst the body of Lord
Lamerton was removed from the place where
it had fallen.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>He stood there now, and looked again, and
saw the destruction of the house he loved. A
crowd of men and boys were on the down,
shouting, laughing, some working, others encouraging
them. Those who had crowbars
drove them into the turf, and worked through
to the rock that came up close to the surface;
then they levered the stones through clefts and
faults, out of place, and sent them plunging
over the edge of the precipice, accompanied
by clouds of dust, and avalanches of rubble.
As each piece went leaping and rolling down
it was saluted with a cheer, and the men leaned
over the edge of the cliff to see where it fell,
and what amount of damage was done by it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The roof of Chillacot was broken through
in several places; the slates at the top of the
chimney, set on edge to divert the draught
from blowing down it, were knocked off. One
huge block had overleaped the house, torn a
track through the flower-bed in front, had beat
down the entrance gate and there halted,
seated on the shattered gate.</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren stood looking on with apparent indifference,
because he was still unable to realise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>what was being done; but the full importance
of the fact that his home was being wrecked
came on him with a sudden rush, the blood
flew into his face, he uttered a shout of rage,
plunged through the bushes, down the hill-side,
dashed through the stream below in the valley,
ran up to his cottage, and for a moment stood
shaking his fist in inarticulate wrath at the men
who looked down on him, laughing and jeering
from the cliff.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had forgotten everything now except
what was before him, and his anger made him
blind and speechless. This was his house,
built by his father; this his garden, tilled by
his own hands. Who had a right to touch his
property?</p>

<p class='c005'>The blacksmith from above shouted to him
to stand off, another mass of rock was dislodged
and would fall. Saltren could see what
menaced. On the piece of rock grew a thorn-tree,
and the thorn was swaying against the
sky with the exertions of the men leaning on
their levers, snapping the ligatures of root-fibre,
and opening the joints in the stone.
But Saltren had no fear for himself in his fury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>at the outrage being done him. Regardless
of the warning cries addressed to him, he
strode over the broken gate, and entered
his partially ruined house.</p>

<p class='c005'>The blacksmith, alarmed, shouted to the
miners engaged on the levers to desist from
their work, as Saltren was in the house below;
but they replied that the stone was moving,
the crack widening between it and the rock,
and that to arrest it was now impossible.</p>

<p class='c005'>The men held their breath, and were for the
moment afraid of the consequence of what they
had done. But they breathed freely a moment
later, as they saw the captain emerge from his
house and cross the garden, and take up a
place out of the reach of danger. What they
did not notice, or disregarded, was that he had
brought out his gun with him. Stephen stood
where he could command those on the cliff,
and levelled and cocked his gun. His strong
jaws were set; his dark eyebrows drawn over
his flashing eyes; there was not a tremor in
his muscles. He watched the swaying thorn;
he saw that in another moment it would come
down along with the mass of rock on which it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>stood, and which it grappled with its claw-like
roots.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What are you about, cap’n?” asked Mrs.
Kite, coming up hastily.</p>

<p class='c005'>He turned his head, smiled bitterly, and
touched the barrel of his gun.</p>

<p class='c005'>“When that rock comes down,” he said,
“one of those above shall follow it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>At that moment the block parted from the
parent rock, and whirled beneath, followed
by a train of dust. It struck the corner of
the chimney, sent the stones of which it was
built flying in all directions, and crashed
through the roof, but left the thorn-bush
athwart the gap it had torn.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before Saltren could discharge his gun,
Mrs. Kite struck it up, and he fired it into
the air.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You fool!” she said, and then burst into
a harsh laugh. “You find fault with others
for doing that you approve yourself. You
would undermine Orleigh, and object to
Chillacot being overthrown.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XL.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>THE END OF A DELUSION.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Captain Saltren remained motionless, with
his gun raised, as it had been struck up by
Patience Kite, for several minutes; then he
slowly lowered it, and turned his face to her.
The troubled expression which of late had
passed over it at intervals returned. The jaw
was no longer set, and the red spots of anger
had faded from his cheeks. The momentary
character of decision his face had assumed was
gone, and now the lips trembled feebly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What was that you said?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>Patience laughed, and pointed to the crag.</p>

<p class='c005'>“See,” she exclaimed, “the gun has
frightened the men; and there comes the
policeman with your son over the down!”
She laughed again. “How the fellows run!
After all, men are cowards.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What was that you said when I was
about to fire?” asked the captain again.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“Said?—why, what is true. You wanted
to rattle down his lordship’s house, and killed
him because he refused to allow it to be
done; and now you object to having your
own shaken down. But there, that is the
way of men.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren remained brooding in thought, with
his eyes on the ground, and the end of the
gun resting where his eyes fell.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Kite taunted him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You kill the man who won’t let you pull
down his house, and you would kill the man
who throws down yours. What are you
going to do now? Prosecute them for the
mischief, and make them patch up again
what they have broken? or will you give up
the point, and let them have their own way,
and the railway to run here, with a station to
Chillacot?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He did not answer. He was considering
Mrs. Kite’s reproach, not her question.
Presently he threw the gun away, and turned
from his wrecked house.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is true,” he said. “Our ways are unequal;
it is very true.” He put his hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>over his face, and passed it before his eyes;
his hand was shaking. “I will go back to
the Owl’s Nest,” he said in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What! leave your house? Do you not
want to secure what has not been broken?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not care about my house. I do not
care about anything in it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But will you not go and see Marianne—your
wife? You do not know where she is,
into what place your son took her, and
whether she is ill?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He looked at her with a mazed expression,
almost as if he were out of his senses, and
said slowly—</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not care about her any more.”
Then, dimly seeing that this calmness needed
justification, he added, “I have condemned
in others what I allow in myself. I have
measured to one in this way, and to myself
in that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He turned away, and went slowly along
the brook to the point at which he had crossed
it with Patience Kite after the death of Lord
Lamerton, when she led him into the covert of
the woods. Mrs. Kite accompanied him now.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>They ascended the further hillside together,
passing through the coppice, and he remained
silent, mechanically thrusting the oak-boughs
apart. He seemed to see, to feel nothing, so
occupied was he with his own thoughts.</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently he came out on the open patch
where he had stood twice before, once to
watch the removal of his victim, next to see
the destruction of his house. There now he
halted, and brushed his arms down, first the
left, then the right with his hands, then passed
them over his shoulders as though he were
sweeping off him something that clung to and
encumbered him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“They are all gone,” said Mrs. Kite
pointing to the headland, “and Jingles is
bringing the policeman down to see the mischief
that has been done.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain Saltren stood and looked across
the valley, but not at his house; he seemed
to have forgotten about it, or lost all concern
in it; he looked away from it, higher up, to
the spot whence Lord Lamerton had fallen.
Mrs. Kite was puzzled at the expression in
his face, and at his peculiar manner. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>had never thought highly of him, now she
supposed he was losing his head. Every
now and then he put up his hand over his mouth
to conceal the contraction and quivering of the
lips; and once she heard him utter a sound
which might have been a laugh, but was more
like a sob, not in his throat, but in his breast.</p>

<p class='c005'>That dread of having been a prey to
delusions, which had passed over him before,
had gained consistency, and burdened him
insupportably. Opposite him was the headland
whence he had precipitated Lord
Lamerton, and now he asked himself why he
had done it. Because he believed his lordship
had hurt him in his family relations? In that
he was mistaken. Because his lordship stopped
the mine and threw him out of work rather
than have his house imperilled? He himself
was as resolute in resisting an attack on his
own property, an interference with his own
house. Because his lordship had occasioned
the death of Arkie Tubb? Now as the veils
of prejudice fell, one after another, he saw
that no guilt attached to his lordship on that
account. The boy had gone in to save Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Kite. It was her fault that he was crushed.
She had allowed her daughter, Arkie, all who
looked on to believe she was endangered,
when she had placed herself in a position of
security. The only way in which he could
allay the unrest in his mind was to repeat
again and again to himself, “It was ordained.
The Lord revealed it. There were reasons
which I did not know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There is a moment, we are told by those
who have ascended in a balloon, when the
cord is cut, and the solid earth is seen to
begin to drift below, the trees to dance, and
the towers to slide away, that an all but over-powering
sense of fear and inclination comes
on one to leap from the car at the risk of
being dashed to pieces. It is said that the
panic produced by an earthquake exceeds
every other terror. When a ship is storm-tossed,
escape is possible in a boat, when a
house is on fire there are feather-beds into
which we can leap; but when the earth is
insecure, then we have nowhere to which we
can flee, nothing to which we can look.</p>

<p class='c005'>With Captain Saltren, his religious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>convictions were what was most stable. Everything
else glided before him as a dream, but
he kept his feet on those things that belonged
to the spiritual world, as if they were
adamantine foundations. And now he was
being, like an aeronaut, caught away, and
these shifted under his eyes; like one in an
earthquake, he felt the strong bases rock beneath
him. The sense of terror that passed
over him was akin to despair; but the
last cord was not snapped, and that was
the firmest of all—his visions and revelations.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of all queer folks,” said Mrs. Kite, “I
reckon you are the queerest, captain. I
thought so from the time I first saw you come
and pray on your raft in the pond, and when
I heard what a tale you had made out of
Miss Arminell throwing a book at you, then
I did begin to believe you were not right in
your mind; now I’m sure of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain Saltren looked dreamily at her;
but in that dreamy look was pain.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That was, to be sure, a wonderful tale,”
pursued Mrs. Kite, losing patience with him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“An angel from Heaven cast the Everlasting
Gospel down to you, was that it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He nodded, but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And I see’d Miss Arminell do it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>His eyes opened wide with alarm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What the name of the book was, I do
not mind; indeed, I do not know, because I
cannot read; but I have got the book, and
can show it you, and you who are a scholar
can read it through from the first word to the
last.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have the book?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have; when it fell it went under your
raft, but it did not sink, it came up after on
the other side, and when you were gone I
fished it out, and I have it now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was red as blood.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aye, and the paint came off on my
fingers, but I dried it in the sun; and I have
the book now, not in the Owl’s Nest, but in
a cupboard of the back kitchen o’ my old
house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“His likeness was on it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That I can’t say. There is a head of a
man.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“The head of Lord Lamerton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It don’t look like it; the man has black
hair and a beard, and his lordship had no
beard, and his hair was light brown.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A shudder came over the captain. Was
his last, his firmest anchor to break?</p>

<p class='c005'>Again, as he had done several times
already, he passed his hands over his arms
and shoulders and sides, as if peeling off what
adhered to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let me see the book,” he said faintly.
“Lead on.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ought to have returned it to Miss Arminell,”
said Mrs. Kite; “but I didn’t, because
my Tamsine saw it, and said she’d like to
read it. She’s mighty fond of what they call
a sensational novel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was the book of the Everlasting
Gospel,” said Saltren with a burst of desperation.
“Nothing will ever make me believe
otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Or that Miss Arminell, who stood in the
mouth of the Owl’s Nest, was an angel flying?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He made no reply, but lowered his head,
and pushed forwards.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>When they reached the ruined hovel, Mrs.
Kite went into that part which had not been
dismantled, and brought forth the crimson-covered
book from the oven, where it had
been hidden, and gave it to her companion.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is ‘The Gilded Clique,’” was all he
said, and fixed his eyes on it with terror in
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>He dared not look Mrs. Kite in the face;
he stood with lowered head before her, and
his hands shook as he held the book, so that
he could not study it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tell me all that you heard and saw,” he
said; then with sudden eagerness, “It was
not on the Sabbath?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” said Mrs. Kite, “it was on a Sunday
that I saw you.” Then she told him all
the circumstances as they had really happened.</p>

<p class='c005'>Wondrous are the phantasmagoric pictures
conjured up by the sun in the desert; the
traveller looks on and sees blue water, flying
sails, palm groves, palaces, and all is so real
that he believes he even hears the muezzin’s
call to prayer from the minarets, and the lap
of the water on the sands, and the chant of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>mariners in the vessels. Then up springs a
cold air, and in a moment the picture is dissolved
and exposes arid waste strewn with
bones and utterly herbless. And the words
of the woman produced some such an effect
on the mind of Saltren. In a minute all the
imaginations that had spun themselves out of
the little bare fact, and overspread and disguised
it, were riven and swept aside.</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain Saltren stood turning the book
about, and looking at the likeness of M.
Emile Gaboriau on the cover; it bore not
the faintest resemblance to the late Lord
Lamerton. The book was headed “Gaboriau’s
Sensational novels, the Favourite Reading
of Prince Bismarck, one shilling.” And
beneath the medallion was “The Gilded
Clique.” Sick at heart, with giddy head,
Captain Saltren opened the book stained
with water, and read, hardly knowing what
he did, an advertisement that occupied the fly
leaf—an advertisement of “Asiatic Berordnung,”
for the production of “whiskers, moustaches,
and hair, and for the cure of baldness,
and the renovation of ladies’ scanty partings.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Was this the revelation which had been
communicated to him? Was it this which
had drawn him on into an ecstasy of fanatical
faith which led him to the commission of
an unprovoked crime?</p>

<p class='c005'>Still half-stunned by his fear he read on.
“Eminent authorities have expressed their entire
approval of the valuable yet perfectly harmless
nature of our discovery. In an age like
this, when a youthful appearance is so against
a young man, those without beard or moustache
being designated boys, and scanty hair,
eyebrows, and eyelashes, so unproductive of
admiration in the fair sex, the Asiatic Berordnung
should be universally adopted. Price
1s. 6d.; full sized bottles 3s. 6d. each.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain Saltren’s face was in colour like
that of a corpse, he raised his eyes for a
moment to Mrs. Kite, and saw the mocking
laugh on her lips. He dropped them again,
and said in a low voice; “Leave me alone, I
cannot think upon what you have said till you
are gone.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will return to Chillacot and see the
ruin,” she said.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“The ruin?” he repeated, “the ruin?”
He had forgotten about his house, he was
looking on a greater ruin than that, the desolation
of a broken-down faith, and of
prostrate self-confidence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mind you do not risk going to the Owl’s
Nest,” said Mrs. Kite; “you are not in condition
for that, your knees scarce support
you. Abide here and read your book, and
see what comfort you can get out of it; a
firm head and a steady foot is needed for that
path.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He made a sign to the woman to go; he
shook as with the palsy; he put his hand to
his head. A band as of iron was tightening
about his temples. He could not endure to
have Mrs. Kite there any longer. He would
go mad unless left alone.</p>

<p class='c005'>She hesitated for a moment, repeated her
injunctions to him to stay where he was till
her return, and then left.</p>

<p class='c005'>He looked after her till she had disappeared,
and for some little while after she
was gone he looked at the bushes that had
closed behind her, fearing lest she should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>return; then he sank down on a heap of stones,
put the book from him with a shudder, and
buried his head in his hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>The mirage was past, the dry and hideous
reality remained, but Saltren had not as yet
quite recovered from the impression of reality
that mirage had produced on his mind. We
cannot on waking from certain dreams drive
them entirely from us, so that they in no way
affect our conduct and influence our opinions.
I know that sometimes I wake after having
dreamed of some amiable and innocent person
in an odious light, and though I fight against
the impression all day, I cannot view that
person without repugnance. Captain Saltren
was aware that he had dreamed, that he had
believed in the reality of the mirage conjured
up by his fancy, had regarded that crimson-covered
book as the revelation of the Everlasting
Gospel, and though his mind assented
to the fact that he had been deceived, he was
unable to drive away the glamour of the
delusion that clung to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>I, who write this, know full well that I
shall find readers, and encounter critics who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>will pronounce the case of Captain Saltren
impossible; because in the London clubs and
in country houses no such delusions are
found. What! are we not all engaged in
blowing soap-bubbles, in painting mirages, in
spinning cobwebs? But then our soap-bubbles,
our mirages, our cobwebs, in which
we, unlike spiders, entangle ourselves, are
not theological, but social and political. Do
we not weave out of our own bowels vast
webs, and hang them up in the sight of all as
substantial realities? And are we not
surprised with paralysing amazement when
we discover that the bubbles we have blown
are not new created worlds, and our cobwebs
are dissolved by a touch? I have seen in
Innsbruck pictures painted on cobwebs of
close texture, with infinite dexterity and
patient toil. We not only spin our cobwebs,
but paint on them, though I allow we do not
picture on them sacred images. Why, my
own path is strewn with these gossamer webs
of my own weaving that never caught any
other midge than my own insignificant self;
me they entangled, they choked my windpipe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>they filled my eyes, they clogged my
ears. Look back, critical reader, at your own
course, and see if it be not encumbered with
such torn and trampled cobwebs. There is
a great German book of nine volumes, each
of over a thousand pages, and it is entitled
“The History of Human Folly.” Alas, it is
not complete! It gives but the record of the
inconceivable follies of a few most salient
characters. But in our own towns, in our
villages, in our immediate families, what
histories of human folly there are unwritten,
but well known, I go closer home—in our
own lives there is a volume for every year
recording our delusions and our inconsequences.</p>

<p class='c005'>In our Latin grammars we learned “Nemo
omnibus horis sapit,” but that may be better
rendered, “Quis non omnibus horis delirat?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The anthropologist and antiquary delight
in exploring the kitchen middens of a lost
race, heaps of bones, and shells, and broken
potsherds rejected by a population that lived
in pre-historic times. But, oh, what kitchen
middens are about our own selves, at our own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>doors, of empty shells and dismarrowed bones
of old convictions, old superstitions, old conceits,
old ambitions, old hopes! Where is
the meat? Where the nutriment? Nowhere;
gone past recall; only the dead husks, and
shells, and bones, and potsherds remain.
Open your desk, pull out the secret drawer,
and what are revealed? A dry flower—the
refuse scrap of an old passion; a worthless
voucher of a bad investment; a MS. poem
which was refused by every magazine; a
mother’s Bible, monument of a dead belief.
Go, turn over your own kitchen middens, and
then come and argue with me that such a
delusion as that of Captain Saltren is impossible.
I tell you it is paralleled every
year.</p>

<p class='c005'>And now, sitting on the heap of stones, full
of doubt, and yet not altogether a prey to
despair, Captain Saltren took the red book
again, and began to read it, first at the beginning,
then turning to the middle, then
looking to the end. Then he put it from him
once more, and, with the cold sweat streaming
over his face, he walked to the edge of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>quarry, and there knelt down to pray. Had
he been deceived? Was he not now subjected
to a fiery trial of his faith—a last assault of
the Evil One? This was indeed a possibility,
and it was a possibility to which he clung desperately.</p>

<p class='c005'>A little while ago we saw Giles Saltren
humiliated and crushed, passing through the
flame of disappointment and disenchantment,
the purgatorial flame that in this life tries
every man. In that fire the young man’s self-esteem
and self-reliance had shrivelled up and
been reduced to ash. And now his reputed
father entered the same furnace.</p>

<p class='c005'>He prayed and wrestled in spirit, wringing
his hands, and with sweat and tears commingled
streaming down his cheeks. He
prayed that he might be given a token. He
could not, he would not, accept the humiliation.
He fought against it with all the powers of
his soul and mind.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he stood up. He was resolved what
to do. He would walk along the ledge of
rock to the Owl’s Nest, holding the red book
in his hand instead of clinging to the ivy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>bands. If that book stayed him up and
sustained him in equilibrium till he reached
the Cave, then he would still believe in his
mission, and the revelations that attended it.
But if he had erred, why then—</p>

<p class='c005'>Holding the book he began the perilous
walk. He took three steps forward, and then
the judgment was pronounced.</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>When Giles Saltren had left town to return
to Orleigh his uncle remained with Arminell.
The girl asked Mr. Welsh to leave her for
half an hour to collect her thoughts and resolve
on what she would do; and he went off
to the British Museum to look at the marbles
till he considered she had been allowed
sufficient time to decide her course, and then
he returned to the inn. She was ready for
him, composed, seated on the sofa, pale, and
dark under the eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, Miss Inglett,” said Welsh, “I’ve
been studying the busts of the Roman
Emperors and their wives, and imagining
them dressed in our nineteenth-century costume;
and, upon my word, I believe they
would pass for ordinary English men and
women. I believe dress has much to do
with the determination of character.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Conceive of Domitian in a light, modern summer
suit—in that he could not be bloodthirsty and
a tyrant. Imagine me in a toga, and you may
imagine me committing any monstrosity.
Dress does it. How about your affairs?
Are you going to Aunt Hermione?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To Lady Hermione Woodhead?” corrected
Arminell, with a touch of haughtiness.
“No.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then what will you do? I’ll take the
liberty of a chair.” He seated himself. “I
can’t get their busts out of my head—however,
go on.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Welsh, I wish to state to you exactly
what I have done, and let you see how I am
circumstanced. I have formed my own
opinion as to what I must do, and I shall be
glad afterwards to hear what you think of my
determination. You have shown me kindness
in coming here, and offering your help,
and I am not so ungracious as to refuse to
accept, to some extent, the help so readily
offered.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall be proud, young lady.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Let me then proceed to tell you how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>stands the case, and then you will comprehend
why I have taken my resolution. I ran away
from home with your nephew, moved by a
vague romantic dream, which, when I try to
recall, partly escapes me, and appears to me
now altogether absurd.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You were not dressed for the part,” threw
in Welsh. “You could no more be the
heroine in modern vest and the now fashionable
hat, than I could commit the crimes of
Cæsar in this suit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In the first place,” pursued Arminell,
disregarding the interruption, “I was filled
with the spirit of unrest and discontent, which
made me undervalue everything I had, and
crave for and over-estimate everything I had
not. With my mind ill at ease, I was ready
to catch at whatever chance offered of escape
from the vulgar round of daily life, and
plunge into a new, heroic and exciting career.
The chance came. Your nephew believed
that he was my half-brother.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Young Jack-an-apes!” intercalated Welsh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That he was my dear father’s son by a
former fictitious marriage with your sister
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Mrs. Saltren, I believed, as firmly as your
nephew believed it; and I was extremely
indignant with my poor father for what I
thought was his dishonourable conduct in the
matter, and for the hypocrisy of his after life.
I thought that, if I ran away with your
nephew, I would force him—I mean my lord—to
acknowledge the tie, and so do an act of
tardy justice to his son. Then, in the next
place, I was filled with exalted ideas of what
we ought to do in this world, that we were to
be social knights errant, rambling about at
our own free will, redressing wrongs, and I
despised the sober virtues of my father, and
the ordinary social duties, with the execution
of which my step-mother filled up her life. I
thought that a brilliant career was open to
your nephew, and that I might take a share
in it, that we would make ourselves names,
and effect great things for the social regeneration
of the age. It was all nonsense and
moonshine. I see that clearly enough now.
My wonder is that I did not see it before.
But the step has been taken and cannot be
recalled. I have broken with my family and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>with my class, I cannot ask to have links
rewelded which I wilfully snapped, to be reinstalled
in a place I deliberately vacated.
Nemesis has overtaken me, and even the
gods bow to Nemesis.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are exaggerating,” interrupted Welsh;
“you have, I admit, acted like a donkey—excuse
the expression, no other is as forcible
and as true—but I find no such irretrievable
mischief done as you suppose. Fortunately
the mistake has been corrected at once. If
you will go home, or to Lady Woodhead—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lady Hermione Woodhead,” corrected
Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Or to Lady Hermione Woodhead—all
will be well. What might have been a catastrophe
is averted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” answered Arminell, “all will not be
well. Excuse me if I flatly contradict you.
There is something else you have not reckoned
on, but which I must take into my calculations.
I shall never forget what I have done,
never forgive myself for having embittered
the last moments of my dear father’s life,
never for having thought unworthily of him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>and let him see that he had lost my esteem.
If I were to return home, now or later from
my aunt’s house, I could not shake off the
sense of self-reproach, of self-loathing which
I now feel. There is one way, and one way
only, in which I can recover my self-respect
and peace of mind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And that is—?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“By not going home.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well—go to your aunt’s.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should be there for a month, and after
that must return to Orleigh. No—that is
not possible. Do you not see that several
reasons conspire against my taking that
course?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pray let me know them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In the first place, it is certain to have
leaked out that I ran away from home. My
conduct will be talked about and commented
on in Orleigh, in the county. It will become
part of the scandal published in the
society papers, and be read and laughed over
by the clerks and shop-girls who take in these
papers, whose diet it is. Everywhere, in all
classes, the story will be told how the Honourable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Arminell Inglett, only daughter of Giles,
tenth Baron Lamerton of Orleigh, and his
first wife, the Lady Lucy Hele, daughter of
the Earl of Anstey, had eloped with the son
of a mining captain, the tutor to her half-brother,
and how that they were discovered
together in a little inn in Bloomsbury.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” said Welsh, impatiently. “If you
will act as Jingles has suggested, this will
never be known. He is back at Orleigh, or
will be there this afternoon, and you will be
at Portland Place, where your maid will find
you. What more natural than that you should
return to-morrow home, on account of your
father’s death? As for the society papers—if
they get an inkling of the real facts—I am
connected with the press. I can snuff the
light out. There are ways and means.
Leave that to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, Mr. Welsh, suppose that suspicion
has been roused at Orleigh—Mrs. Cribbage
has to be considered. That woman will not
leave a stone unturned till she has routed
out everything. I used to say that was why
the finger ends were always out of her gloves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>I would have to equivocate, and perhaps to
lie, when asked point-blank questions which
if answered would betray the truth. I would
be putting my dear step-mother to the same
inconvenience and humiliation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Trust her wit and knowledge of the
world to evade Mrs. Cribbage.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I cannot. I have not the wit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Welsh was vexed, he stamped impatiently.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can’t follow you in this,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, Mr. Welsh, then perhaps you may
in what I give you as my next reason. I feel
bound morally to take the consequences of
my act. When a wretched girl flings herself
over London Bridge, perhaps she feels a
spasm of regret for the life she is throwing
away, as the water closes over her, but she
drowns all the same.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not at all, when there are boats put forth
to the rescue, and hands extended to haul her
in.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To rescue her for what?—To be brought
before a magistrate, and to have her miserable
story published in the daily penny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>papers. Why, Mr. Welsh, her friends regret
that her body was not rolled down into the
deep sea, or smothered under a bed of
Thames mud; that were better than the
publication of her infamy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What will you have?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have made the plunge; I must go
down.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not if I can pull you out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You cannot pull me out. I made my
leap out of my social order. What I have
done has been to commit social suicide.
There is no recovery for me save at a cost
which I refuse to pay. I have heard that
those who have been half drowned suffer
infinite agonies on the return of vitality. I
shrink from these pains. I know what it
would be were I fished up and thrown on my
own shore again. I would tingle and smart
in every fibre of my consciousness, and cry
out to be cast in again. No, Mr. Welsh,
through youthful impetuosity and wrong-headedness
I have jumped out of my social
world, and I must abide by the consequences.
As the Honourable Arminell Inglett I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>ceased to exist. I die out of the peerage, die
out of my order, die out of the recognition,
though not the memory of my relatives. But
I live on as plain Miss Inglett, one of the
countless members of the great Middle Class.”</p>

<p class='c005'>James Welsh looked at the girl with
puzzlement in his face. Spots of flame had
come into her pale cheeks, and to the
temples, as she spoke, and she moved her
slender fingers on her lap in her eagerness to
make herself explicit and her difficulties intelligible.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t understand you, Miss Inglett.
That is, I do not see what is your intention.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mean that I have committed social
suicide, and I do not wish to be saved either
for my friends’ sake or for my own. I ask
you kindly to get my death inserted in the
<i>Times</i> and the other daily papers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your actual death?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A statement that on such a day died the
Honourable Arminell Inglett, only daughter
of the late Lord Lamerton. That will
suffice; it proclaims to society that I have
ceased to belong to it. Of course my dear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>step-mother and my aunt and the family
solicitors shall know the truth. I have
money that comes to me from my mother.
A statement of my death in the <i>Times</i> will
not constitute legal death, but it will suffice
to establish my social death.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are taking an extraordinary and
unwarrantable course.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Extraordinary it may be, but not unwarranted.
I have the justification within, in
my conscience. When one has done that
which is wrong, one is called to suffer for it,
and the conscience is never cleansed and
restored without expiating pains. If I were
to return to Orleigh I would die morally, of
that I am sure, because it would be a shirking
of the consequences which my foolish act has
brought down on me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There may be something in that,” said
Welsh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will write to Lady Lamerton and tell
her everything and assure her that my decision
is irrevocable. I have caused her so
much pain, I have behaved so badly to my
father, I have been so ungrateful for all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>happy days and pleasant comforts of dear,
dear Orleigh”—her eyes filled with tears,
and she was unable to finish her sentence.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Welsh said nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” she said, after a pause—“No, Mr.
Welsh, I cannot in conscience go home, there
to dissemble and lie to Mrs. Cribbage and to
neighbours; and never to be able to shake
off the sense of self-reproach for not having
frankly accepted the results of my own misconduct.
Do you know, Mr. Welsh, I was
angry with my father because I thought he
was evading his retribution?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Welsh, usually a talkative man, felt
no inclination now to say a word.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Welsh,” said Arminell, “I ask you
to go to Portland Place, call on Lady Hermione
Woodhead, she is a practical woman
of the world; lay the entire case before her,
and see if she does not say, ‘Throw her in
again, for Heaven’s sake, so as to keep the
story out of the papers.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And if her ladyship does not say
so?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She will say it.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“If she does not, but asks me to bring
you to her, will you go to Portland Place?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No; my resolution is taken.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Welsh stood up and paced the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What the deuce will you do?” he asked.
“You are quite a girl, and a pretty girl, and
confoundedly inexperienced. You cannot,
you must not live alone. My Tryphœna is
a good soul; it is true that we are without a
cook, but if you do not object to rissoles I
shall be happy to offer you such hospitality
as my house affords. Shepherd’s Bush is
not the most aristocratic quarter of the town,
but Poplar is worse; it is not near the
theatres and the parks, but you’re welcome
to it. Your idea is startling. I’ll go into
that <i>cul-de-sac</i>, Queen’s Square, where runs
no cab, no ’bus does rumble, and consider it
there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you see my aunt, Lady Hermione?
It will save me writing, and you can explain
the circumstances by word better than I can
tell them with a pen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bless me! I have a mind to do so.”
He stopped, went to the window, came back,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>and said abruptly, “Yes, I will. God bless
me! To think that I—I of all men, a
raging Democrat, should be hansoming to
and fro between my Ladies and Honourables.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You can do what will give you pleasure,”
said the girl with a faint smile—“with a
stroke of the pen convert the Honourable
Arminell into plain Miss Inglett.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He did not laugh at the sally. He came
in front of her, and stood contemplating her,
with his hands behind his back.</p>

<p class='c005'>“God bless me!” he said, “one can be
heroic after all in modern costume. I didn’t
think it. Well, I will go, but write me a line
to ensure her receiving me in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell did as required.</p>

<p class='c005'>When she had finished the note and was
folding it, she looked up at Welsh, and
asked, “Have you read the Hecuba?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Hecuba? Classic? Not even in
Bohn’s translation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then the saying of Hecuba to Polyxenes
will not occur to you: ‘I am dead before my
death, through my ills.’”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“I will go,” he said, and held out his hand.
“Give me a shake—it will do me good.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, Mr. Welsh, you will return to me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes.” His mouth and eyes were twitching.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Deuce take it! an aristocrat can do an
heroic thing even with a vest and toupee.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Two hours later the journalist returned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Confound these aristocrats,” he said, as
he entered, hot and puffing. “They live in
daily, hourly terror of public opinion. I
wouldn’t be one of them, existing in such a
state of quivering terror, not for anything
you could offer me. They are like a man I
knew who spent all his energies in fighting
against draughts. He put sandbags to the
bottom of his doors, stuffed cotton-wool into
the crevices of his windows, papered over the
joints of his flooring, corked up the key-holes,
and yet was always catching catarrh from
draughts that came from—no one knows
where. What they fear is breath—the breath
of public opinion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What did my aunt say?” asked Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“Say? In the most elegant and roundabout
way what may be summarized in four
words—‘Chuck her in again.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I said as much.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, Miss Inglett. I have telegraphed
to Tryphœna to do two extra rissoles. We
shall pass the stores, and I’ll buy a tin of
prawns and a bottle of Noyeau jelly. Pack
up your traps. The cab is at the door.
Sorry to-day is Monday, or you should have
had something better than rissoles.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XLII.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>SHEPHERD’S BUSH.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“Here we are,” said Mr. Welsh, “The
Avenue—the most stylish part of Shepherd’s
Bush, as it is of New York. You sit still in
the fly whilst I go in and make an explanation
to her ladyship. I’ll take that bottle of
Noyeau you have been nursing; I have the
canister of prawns in my coat-pocket; I am
sorry before purchasing it that I forgot to
ask you if you preferred Loch Awe salmon.
What is your favourite tipple? You will
hear from my wife that we have no cook.
The last we got became inebriated, and we
had to dismiss her. We have been without
one for a fortnight. Tryphœna—that is, her
ladyship—upon my word I have been so
mixed up with aristocrats of late, that I find
myself giving a title to every one I meet.
What was I saying? Oh! that her ladyship
has all the cooking to do now? You sit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>quiet. No fumbling after your purse; I pay
the cabby because I engaged him. We of
the Upper Ten, under present depression, do
not keep our own carriages and livery servants—we
hire as we want.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Under all Welsh’s rollicking humour lay
real kindness of heart. Arminell felt it, and
drew towards this man, so unlike any other
man with whom she was acquainted, or
whom she had met. She knew that he was
perfectly reliable, that he would do everything
in his power to serve her, and that a
vast store of tenderness and consideration lay
veiled under an affectation of boisterousness
and burlesque.</p>

<p class='c005'>How is it that when we do a kindness we
endeavour to minimise it? We disguise the
fact that what we do costs us something, that
it gives us trouble, that it draws down on us
irksome responsibilities? It is not that we
are ashamed of ourselves for doing kindnesses,
that we think it unmanly to be unselfish, but
rather that we fear to embarrass the person
who receives favours at our hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Welsh had really sacrificed much that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>day for Arminell. He was to have met an
editor and arranged with him for articles for
his paper. He had not kept his appointment;
that might possibly be resented, and lead to
pecuniary loss, to some one else being engaged
in his room. Editors are unforgiving.
“Yes,” said Mr. Welsh that same afternoon,
when he found that what he dreaded had
occurred, “a Domitian is possible still in our
costume, but the tyrants confine their ferocity
to aspirants after literary work. They cut
off their heads, they put out their eyes, and
they disjoint their noses wholesale.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently Welsh put his head to the cab
door and said cheerfully, “All right, I’ve
broken it to her ladyship. She don’t know
all. You are a distant and disowned relative
of the noble house of Lamerton. That is
what I have told her; and I am your guardian
for the time. I have explained. Come in.
The maid-of-all-work don’t clean herself till
the afternoon, and is now in hiding behind
the hall door. She spends the morning in
accumulating the dirt of the house on her
person, when no one is expected to call, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>she scrubs it off after lunch.” He opened the
cab door, and conducted her into the house.
“I will lug the slavey out from behind the
door,” he said, “if you will step into the
dining room; and then she and I will get the
luggage from the cab. Your room is not yet
ready. Go in there.” He opened the door
on his left, and ushered Arminell into the
little apartment.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Excuse me if I leave you,” he said, “and
excuse Mrs. Welsh for a bit. She is rummaging
somewhere. We have, as she will tell
you presently, no cook. The last—” he made
pantomimic signs of putting a bottle to his
lips. Then he went out, and for a while
there reached Arminell from the narrow front
passage, somewhat grandly designated the
hall, sounds of the moving of her luggage.</p>

<p class='c005'>A moment later, and a whispered conversation
from outside the door reached her ears.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s no use—there are only scraps. How
can you suggest rissoles? There is no time
for the preparation of delicacies. If we are
to have them, it must be for dinner. I did
not expect you at noon, much less that you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>would be bringing a visitor. Your telegram
arrived one minute before yourself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not so loud,” whispered James Welsh,
“or she will hear. You must provide enough
to eat, of course. Send out for steak.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nonsense, James; it is lunch time already.
She must manage with scraps, and them cold
scraps are wholesome. What doesn’t poison
fattens.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You couldn’t, I suppose, have the scraps
warmed, or”—somewhat louder, with a flash
of inspiration—“or converted into a haricot?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How can you talk like this, James? Go
on, suggest that they shall be made into a
mayonnaise next. To have hot meat means
a fire, and there is none to speak of in the
kitchen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Only dead scraps! My dear Tryphœna,
she belongs to a titled family, a long way off
and disowned, you understand, but still—there
is a title in the family and—scraps!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What else will you have, James? Had
you been home yesterday for dinner, there
would have been joint, roast; but as you were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>not, I ate cold meat. Now there are only
scraps.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perhaps if you were to turn out the
Noyeau jelly in a shape, Tryphœna, it would
give the lunch a more distinguished look.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Scraps of cold boiled mutton and Noyeau
jelly! No, that won’t do. The jelly must
be warmed and melted into the shape, and
take three hours to cool.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish I had taken her to the Holborn
Restaurant,” groaned Welsh; “what difficulties
encumber domestic arrangements!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Without a cook—yes,” added his wife.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do go in and welcome her,” urged Mr.
Welsh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot in this condition. You know I
have no cook, and must attend to everything.
The girl has been impudent this morning,
and has given me notice.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Whilst this discussion was being carried on,
Arminell tried not to listen, but the whispers
were pitched so high, and were so articulate
that scarce a word escaped her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Mr. Welsh whispered, “Do lower
your voice, Tryphœna,” and the pair drifted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>down the passage to the head of the kitchen
steps, and what was further discussed there
was inaudible.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell looked round the room. Its
most prominent feature was the gas-lamp
with double burner and globes—the latter a
little smoked, suspended from the ceiling by
a telescopic tube that allowed just sufficient
gas to escape at the joints to advertise itself
as gas, not paraffin or electric fluid. This
room was the one in which, apparently, Mrs.
Welsh sat when she had a cook, and was not
engrossed in domestic affairs. Her workbox,
knitting, a railway novel, bills paid and
unpaid, and one of Mr. Welsh’s stockings with
a hole in the heel, showed that she occupied
this apartment occasionally.</p>

<p class='c005'>The door opened, and Mrs. Welsh entered,
followed by her husband. She was a stout
lady with a flat face, and a pair of large dark
eyes, her only beauty. Her hair was not
tidy, nor were all the buttons and hooks in
place and performing their proper functions
about her body.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How do you do?” she said, extending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>her hand; “I’m sorry to say I have no cook;
nothing is more difficult than to find cooks with
characters now-a-days; ladies will give such
false characters. What I say is, tell the truth,
whatever comes of it. My last cook had a
glowing character from the lady with whom
she lived in Belgrave Square. I assure you
she was in a superior house, quite aristocratic—carriage
people; but I could not
keep her. I did not myself find out that she
drank. I did not suspect it. I knew she
was flighty—but at last she went up a ladder,
sixty feet high, and could hardly be got down
again. It was in an adjoining builder’s yard.
The ladder leaned against nothing, it pointed
to the sky, and she went up it, and though a
stout and elderly woman, looked no bigger than
a fly when she had reached the top. Won’t
you sit down? or stay—let me take you up
to the parlour. We will have the table laid
directly for lunch. Mr. Welsh does not
generally come home at this time of day, so
I was unprepared, and I have no cook. The
ladder began to sway with her, for she became
nervous at the top, and afraid to come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>down; quite a crowd collected. Do take off
your things. Your room will be ready presently.
In the meantime you can lay your
bonnet in the drawing-room. I am short of
hands now. The steps are rather narrow
and steep, but I will lead the way. I’ll see
to having water and soap and a towel taken
to the best bed-room presently, but my
servant is now making herself neat. None
of the police liked to go up the ladder after
my cook. The united weights at the top,
sixty feet, would have made it sway like a
bulrush, and perhaps break. This is the
drawing-room. Do make yourself comfortable
in it and excuse me. My father and
mother were carriage people. There he is in
his uniform, between the windows, taken
when he was courting my mother. You will
excuse me, or the girl will spread a dirty
instead of a clean tablecloth for lunch. Dear
me, the blinds have not been drawn up!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Mrs. Welsh departed. All men and
women trail shadows behind them when the
sun shines in their faces, but some women, in
all conditions of the heavens, drag behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>them braid. It would seem as if they had
their skirts bound to come undone. As in
the classic world certain females were described
as being with relaxed zones, so are
there females in the modern world in a perpetual
condition of relaxed bindings. If Mrs.
Welsh had lived in a palæozoic period, when
the beasts that inhabited the globe impressed
their footprints on the pliant ooze,
what perplexity her traces would now produce
among the palæontologists, and what
triumph in the minds of the anthropologists,
who would conclude that these were the
footprints of the <i>homo caudatus</i>, the missing
link between the ape and man, and point
in evidence to the furrow accompanying the
impressions of the feet; and Mrs. Welsh
always did wear a tail, but the tail was of
black binding, sometimes looped, sometimes
dragging in ends. As Arminell followed
Mrs. Welsh up the stairs, she had to keep
well in the rear to avoid treading on this tail.</p>

<p class='c005'>On reaching the drawing-room, Arminell
laid her bonnet and cloak on the sofa, and
looked round the room as she looked about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>that below. The latter had been dreary to
the eyes, the former had the superadded
dreariness of pretence.</p>

<p class='c005'>Houses that are uninhabited are haunted
by ghosts, and unoccupied rooms by smells.
The carpet, the curtains, the wall-paper, the
chintz covers, the cold fire-place, send forth
odours urgent to attract attention, as soon as
the door opens. They are so seldom seen
that they <i>will</i> be smelt.</p>

<p class='c005'>The drawing-room in the Avenue was
small, with two narrow windows to it; the
walls were papered with an æsthetic dado of
bulrushes and water weeds, on a pea-green
base; above that ran a pattern picked out
with gold, a self-assertive paper. Above the
marble mantelshelf was a chimney-piece of
looking-glasses and shelves, on which stood
several pieces of cheap modern china, mostly
Japanese, such as are seen outside Glaves in
Oxford Street, in baskets, labelled, “Any of
this lot for 2d.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Against the wall opposite the windows
were two blue Delft plates, hung by wires.
Between the windows was the miniature of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>the father of Mrs. Welsh, once a carriageman,
but not looking it, wearing the uniform
of a marine officer, and the languishment of
a lover. He was represented with a waxy
face, a curl on his brow, and either water or
wadding on his chest.</p>

<p class='c005'>Upon the table were books radiating from
a central opal specimen glass that contained
three or four dry everlastings, smelling like
corduroys; and the books in very bright
cloth had their leaves glued together with the
gilding.</p>

<p class='c005'>Unhappy, occupied with her own trouble
though Arminell was, yet she noted these
things because they were so different from
that to which she was accustomed. Perhaps
the rawness of the decoration, the strain after
impossible effect, struck Arminell more than
the lack of taste. She had been accustomed
to furniture and domestic decoration pitched
in a key below that of the occupants, but
here everything was screwed up above that
of such as were supposed to use the room.
Elsewhere she had seen chairs and sofas to
be sat on, carpets to be walked on, books to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>be read, wall papers to be covered with
paintings. Here even the sun was not
allowed to touch the carpet, and the chairs
were to be made use of gingerly, and the
fire-irons not to be employed at all, and the
grate most rarely. After Arminell had spent
half-an-hour in this parlour, the whole house
reverberated with the boom of a gong; and
next moment Mrs. Welsh came in to say that
lunch was ready. She had in the meantime
dressed herself to do the honours of the
meal; had changed her gown, then brushed
her hair, and put on rings. Nevertheless
she lacked finish. The brooch was not
fastened, and threatened to fall, and her dress
improver had not been accurately and symmetrically
fitted to her person.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Welsh,” she said, “has departed. He
is very sorry, but business calls must be
attended to. Never mind, I’ll do what I can
to entertain you. I will tell you the end of
the story of my cook up a ladder. Ah!”
she exclaimed on reaching the foot of the
stairs—“is that your umbrella fallen on the
floor? You stuck it up against the wall, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>doubt. The gong has done it, shaken it
down with the vibration.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The lunch was plain, but the good lady had
made an effort to give it the semblance of
elegance. She had sent out for parsley to
garnish the cold mutton, and for a dish of
lettuce and another of watercress, and had
set a just uncorked bottle of Castle A Claret
on the table beside Arminell’s plate.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’ll excuse if we help ourselves and
dispense with the girl,” said Mrs. Welsh.
“Have you had much to do with servants?
I have applied to the registry offices for a
cook and can’t get one; they object to
Shepherd’s Bush, or else want to redeem
their characters at my expense. I have
applied at the hospital for a convalescent, but
if I get one, she will not be up to much work,
and besides will have been so pampered in
hospital, that she will not accommodate herself
to our fare, and will leave as soon as she
is well. If we were carriage people, it would
be different. Servants won’t remain in a
situation where a carriage and pair are not
kept. They think it immoral. Were your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>parents carriage people? And did your
mother have much trouble with her servants?
And, if I may ask, where did she go to for
her cooks?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My mother died shortly after my birth,
and my father recently.” Arminell spoke
with a choke in her voice. “I have not had
time to get mourning. I must do some
shopping this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can show you where you can get things
very cheap. You take a ’bus along Goldhawk
Road; it costs but twopence if you walk
as far as Shepherd’s Bush Station, otherwise
it comes to threepence. I suppose you have
kept home for your father? Did you meet
with impertinence from servants? But I dare
say you kept your carriage. If you don’t do
that they regard you as their equals. They
divide mankind into castes—the lowest keep
no conveyances, the middle have one-horse
traps, and the superior and highest of all
keep a pair and close carriage. My parents
were carriage people—indeed, my father was
an officer in her Majesty’s service. My
husband will some day, I trust, have his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>equipage. His sister is very intimate with
people of distinction. I don’t mean carriage
people only, but titled persons, the highest
nobility. She was a bosom friend of the
dowager Lady Lamerton, she told me so herself.
I almost expect the Lamerton family
to call on me. Should they do so whilst you
are here, I shall be happy to introduce you.
By the way—your name is Inglett, you must
be a distant connexion of the family. James
said you were related to a noble family, but
that they did not receive you. In the event
of a call, perhaps you would prefer to remain
in the dining-room. My husband’s nephew
is called after his lordship, Giles Inglett,
because my lord stood godfather to him at
the font. I assure you the intimacy between
Marianne and the family is most cordial. I
wonder what Mrs. Tomkins over the way
will say when their carriage stops at my
gate! What a pity it is that the British
nobility should be the hotbed of vice.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is it?” asked Arminell listlessly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed it is. I know a great deal about
the aristocracy. My sister-in-law moves in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>the highest circles. I read all the divorce
cases in high life, and I have an intimate
friend who is much in great houses—in fact,
she nurses there. Persons of good family
when reduced in circumstances become trained
nurses. This lady has nursed Sir Lionel
Trumpington, and I could tell you a thing
or two about his family she has confided to
me—but you are not married. She had the
charge of chief Justice Bacon’s daughter, who
was a dipsomaniac, and so had the <i>entrée</i> into
the best families, and has told me the most
extraordinary and shocking stories about
them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>After lunch, Mrs. Welsh said, “There now,
go up to the parlour, and sit there an hour,
till I am ready. I must see that the girl does
your room, after which I will put on my walking
clothes. I will take you where you can
get crape, just a little crumpled and off colour,
at half-price. We will walk to the railway
arch and so save a penny.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell sat by herself in the drawing-room;
the sun was streaming in, but Mrs.
Welsh allowed the blinds to remain undrawn.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>She stood hesitatingly with hand raised to
draw them, but went away, leaving them
rolled up, a concession to the presence of a
visitor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell’s mind turned from her own
troubles to the consideration of the life Mrs.
Welsh and those of her social grade led.
How utterly uninteresting, commonplace, aimless
it seemed; how made up of small pretences,
absurd vanities, petty weaknesses, and considerable
follies! A few days ago, such a
revelation of sordid middle-class triviality
would have amused her. Now it did not.
She saw something beside all the littleness
and affectation, something which dignified it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Everywhere in life is to be observed a
straining after what is above; and the wretched
drunken cook scrambling up a ladder that led
to nothing, blindly exemplified the universal
tendency. As among the plants in a garden,
and the trees of a plantation, there is manifest
an upward struggle, so is it in the gardens
and plantations of humanity. The servant,
as Mrs. Welsh had said, is not content to
serve where no servant is kept, and changes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>to a situation where there is a pony-chaise;
then feels a yearning in her that fills her with
unrest till she has got into a sphere where
there is a one-horse brougham, and deserts
that again for the house that maintains a
landau and pair. In the lower class an effort
is made to emulate the citizens of the middle
class, in dress and arrangement of hair, and
mode of speech; and in the middle class is
apparent protracted effort to reach the higher;
or if it cannot be reached, to hang on to it by
a miniature and a sister-in-law, and a trained
nurse friend. Is this ridiculous? Of course
it is ridiculous to see cooks scrambling up
ladders that reach nowhere, but it is infinitely
better that they should do this than throw
themselves into the gutter. And so thought
Arminell now. Mrs. Welsh may have been
absurd, but behind all her nonsense beat a
true and generous heart, full of aspiration after
something better, and a cheerful spirit of
hospitality and self-sacrifice. No. Arminell
saw the struggle in the woman’s face about
the blinds, and respected her. But when she
was gone, the girl stood up, went to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>windows, and drew down the blinds, to
save from fading Mrs. Welsh’s new gaudy
carpet.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XLIII.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>DOWSING.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>A few days later, towards evening, Mr.
James Welsh arrived, after having been
absent from home. He had not told his wife
or Arminell the cause of his departure, nor
whither he was going. When he returned,
he informed Arminell that he had been away
on business, and that he wanted a word with
her in the parlour.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is no gas in the drawing-room.
Will you have a lamp?” asked Mrs. Welsh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you. It will be unnecessary.
At this time of the year it is not dark, and
the dusk is agreeable for a <i>tête-à-tête</i>. My
business does not need reference to papers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then I will go down and see about
locking up the remains of the plum-pudding.
The girl has had her share set apart on a
plate, and I object to her consuming everything
that goes out from dinner. There is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>enough of the pudding left to serve up fried
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell and Mr. Welsh mounted the
steep stairs to the sitting-room. The parlour
was close and stuffy; Welsh went to the
window and opened it a little way.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do sit down, Miss Inglett,” he said,
“there, on the sofa, with your back to the
window, if you are not afraid of a breath of
air. This twilight is restful to the eyes and
grateful to the overwrought brain. There is
no need for candles.” He seated himself
away from her, looking in another direction,
and said, “I suppose you can guess where I
have been?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed I cannot, Mr. Welsh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have been at Orleigh. I thought I
would like to be present at your father’s
funeral. Besides, I belong to the press, and
my duties took me there. Also, my sister is
left a widow. You may not, perhaps, have
heard of the death of Captain Saltren?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Captain Saltren dead!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, drowned in the old quarry pit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I remember having once seen him there.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>He was a strange man. He went there to
say his prayers, and he prayed on a kind of
raft of his own construction. I suppose it
gave way under him, or he overbalanced
himself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Possibly. How he fell is not known.
He was very strange in his manner of late,
so that the general opinion is that he was off
his head. He had visions, or fancied that he
had.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell said no more on this matter.
She was desirous of hearing about her
father’s funeral.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was present when Lord Lamerton was
taken to his last rest,” said Welsh; “you
cannot have any conception what an amount
of feeling was elicited by his death. By me
it was unexpected. I could not have supposed
that the people, as distinguished from
the aristocracy, would have been other than
coldly respectful, but his lordship must have
been greatly beloved.” Welsh paused, and
rubbed his chin. “Yes, much loved. Of
course, I had only seen one side of him, and
that was the side I cared to see, being a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>professional man, and professionally engaged to
see only one side. That is in the way of
business, and just as a timber merchant
measures a tree, and estimates it by the
amount of plank it will make, regardless of its
effect in the landscape, so it is with me. I
look on a man, especially a nobleman, from a
commercial point of view, and ask how many
feet of type I can get out of him. I don’t
consider him for any other qualities he may
have than those which serve my object.
But I will admit that there must have been a
large amount of kindness and sterling worth
in his lordship, or there would not have been
such a demonstration at his funeral, and that
not by a party, but general—not cooked, but
spontaneous. One expected to see the
quality at the funeral, but what surprised me
was the real sorrow expressed by the people.
Why, bless you! what do you think? Because
Captain Saltren had denounced his
lordship, and prophesied his death, the mob
rolled stones down the cliff on Chillacot and
ruined the house and spoiled the garden.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Pope Leo X. was inaccessible except to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>buffoons, and when a priest desired an interview
with his Holiness, but was unable to
obtain one in the ordinary manner, he dressed
himself in motley, and as a clown obtained
immediate admission.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are some people who suppose that
every one else has the peculiarities of Leo
X., and who never approach their fellows,
even when they have to speak on matters of
serious import, without putting on cap and
bells. They labour under the conviction that
“the motley,” as Jaques said to the Duke,
“is the only wear,” especially when most
inappropriate to the matter of discourse.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Welsh was desirous of doing what was
kind, of conveying to Arminell what he knew
was to her painful information, describing to
her scenes which must stir her emotions, but
he could not assume a sympathetic and
serious tone. He was possessed by that
perverse spirit which forces a man to garnish
his story, however tragic, with quirks and
scraps of illustration incongruous and out of
taste. He was at heart full of pity for
Arminell; he had not gone to Orleigh on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>journalistic ends, though not averse to paying
his travelling expenses by turning what he
had seen into type, but he had gone for the
girl’s sake, and only learned the death of his
brother-in-law on reaching Orleigh. He
knew that she hungered for information
which she could not receive through the
channels formerly open to her. As he spoke
to her, his heart swelled, and he had some
difficulty in controlling his emotion. Nevertheless,
he assumed a tone of half banter, that
galled his own sense of propriety as much as
it jarred on Arminell. And this masquerade
was assumed by him as much to disguise his
real self from himself as from the girl.
Verily, in our horror of hypocrisy, we are
arrant hypocrites. Essayists and satirists
have united to wage a crusade against cant,
and have succeeded so completely that we
dread the semblance of piety, kindliness,
sweetness, lest they be taken as an assumption
only. In the reaction against false appearances
of goodness we have run into the
opposite extreme, and put on a false appearance
of roughness, hardness, and cynicism.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Lest we should be taken to be apricots, with
sweet outside and hard interior, we affect to
be walnuts, rugged and bitter. A woman
poses to herself in the glass, and adorns herself
with jewelry to give pleasure first to
herself and then to others; but men cock
their hats, smut their noses, make grimaces
in the glass, and having sneered at their own
buffoon appearance, pass off the same pranks
on their acquaintance. They will neither
allow to themselves nor to others that they
acknowledge a serious interest in the drama
of life, that they have respect for what is
noble, pity for what is suffering, reverence
for what is holy. They affect to cast burlesque
into all relations of life, as salt is
put into all dishes, to make them palatable.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell was not deceived by the manner
of James Welsh; under the affectation of
selfishness and callousness she recognised the
presence of generous sympathy, just as she
had seen the same quality under the chatter
and pretence of the wife.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the beginning of this story we saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Arminell present at what we called the grand
transformation scene in the pantomime of
life; now she had reached another, and that
a more startling, thorough-going transformation
scene. She saw the world and the
performers therein differently from the way
in which she had seen them before, the world
in a real light, the performers in undress.
She had got behind the scenes, and into the
green-room. Delusion was no longer possible;
she saw the framework of the scenery,
the contrivances for the production of effects,
and the actors oiling their faces with cotton-wool
to remove the paint.</p>

<p class='c005'>In former times there existed in England
a profession which has become extinct—the
profession of dowsing. A dowser was a man
who laid claim to the peculiar gift of discernment
of metal and of water. He was employed
to discover mines and springs. He
took in his hands a forked hazel rod, holding
in each hand one of the branches. When he
walked over a hidden vein of metal, or a
subterranean artery of water, the rod revolved
in his hands, and pointed downwards, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>wherever it pointed, there he ordered the
sinking of a shaft or well.</p>

<p class='c005'>But, although dowsing after minerals and
fountains has ceased to be practised, we still
have among us moral dowsers, and it is even
possible for us to become adepts at dowsing
ourselves.</p>

<p class='c005'>The old dowsers insisted that their profession
was not an art but an inherent faculty.
The dowser was born, not made. But in
moral dowsing this is not the case. The
faculty can most certainly be acquired, but
only on one condition, that we begin with
dowsing our own selves. <i>Fiat experimentum
in corpore vili.</i> Unconsciously Arminell had
been invested with this power; it had come
on her at once, on that morning when her
folly, her error, had been revealed to her
consciousness. From that memorable moment,
when she came to know herself as she really
was, not as she had fancied herself to be, the
manner in which she viewed other natures
with which she was brought in contact was
radically changed. She found herself no
longer as heretofore occupied with the outer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>surface, its ups and downs, its fertility or its
barrenness; the invisible rod turned in her
hands and revealed to her the hidden veins
of ore and motive currents. She saw the
silver thread deep below the most unpromising
surface, the limpid spring under the most
rugged exterior.</p>

<p class='c005'>As she overlooked the superficial flaws in
Mr. and Mrs. Welsh because she recognised
their substantial goodness, so did she begin
now to perceive what had before been unnoticed
in the characters of her father and
step-mother. She had had eyes previously
only for their foibles and infirmities, now she
saw how full of sterling qualities both had
been, of punctual fulfilment of duties, of conscientious
discharge of the obligations imposed
on them by their position and wealth,
of hearty good-will for all with whom they
were brought in contact. She had disregarded
her little half-brother, the present
Baron Lamerton, because he was only a child
with childish thoughts, childish pursuits,
and childish prattle; and now she saw that
his was a very tender, loving spirit, which it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>would have been worth her while to cultivate.
In the first moment of disappointment,
humiliation and anger, she had been incensed
against Jingles for having assisted her in
perpetrating her great mistake. She saw
what a fool he had been, how conceited, how
ungrateful, but even over this forbidding soil
the divining rod turned, and revealed a vein
of noble metal. If it had not been there, he
would not have accepted his humiliation with
frankness and have shown so decided a moral
rebound.</p>

<p class='c005'>When one who has the dowsing faculty is
in the society of those who lack it, and listens
to their talk, their disparagement of others,
the captiousness with which they pick at
trivial blemishes, sneer at infirmities, blame
short-comings, that person listens with a sort
of wonder at the blindness of the talkers, at
their lack of perception, because their eyes
never penetrate below the surface, and a sort
of pity that they have never turned it inwards
and searched themselves, not for silver
but for dross.</p>

<p class='c005'>The knight Huldbrand, when riding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>through the Enchanted Wood, had his eyes
opened, and beneath the turf and the roots
of the trees, he looked through, as it were, a
sheet of green glass, and saw the gold and
silver veins in the earth, and the spirits that
worked at, and directed their courses, opening
sluices here and stopping currents there.
So it is with those invested with the dowsing
gift—with them in the Enchanted Wood of
Life.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the twilight room Arminell listened to
Mr. Welsh’s story of the funeral of her
father, with tears running down her cheeks,
regardless of the manner in which the story
was told, in the intensity of her interest in
the matter, and conscious of the intention of
the narrator.</p>

<p class='c005'>The death of Lord Lamerton had indeed
evoked an amount of feeling and regret that
showed how deeply-rooted was the estimation
in which his good qualities were held, and
how unreal was the agitation that had been
provoked against him.</p>

<p class='c005'>The county papers of all political complexions
gave laudatory notices of the late
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>nobleman. Every one who had come within
range of his influence had good words to say
of him, and lamented his loss as that of a
relative. Selfish interest undoubtedly mixed
with the general regret. The sportsmen
feared that the subscription to the foxhounds
would not be maintained on the same liberal
scale; the parsons, that on the occurrence of
a vacancy in the Lamerton patronage, their
claims would be overlooked by the trustees;
the medical men regretted that the death
had been too sudden to advantage them professionally;
the benevolent societies feared
that the park would not be thrown open to
them with the same liberality; the young
ladies that there would be no ball at Orleigh
next winter; the topers that they would not
taste again the contents of a famous cellar;
the tradesmen that money would not be spent
in the little country town; the artisans that
work would be abandoned and hands discharged.
Of course there was self-interest
in the minds of those who lamented the loss
of Lord Lamerton, regret was not unmingled
with selfish feeling; but, then, what motives,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>what emotions are unmixed? The coin of
the realm is not pure, it consists of metal
and alloy; and the feelings that pass current
among men are not less adulterated.
But are they the less estimable on that
account? Would they pass if unmixed?
Would they be as poignant if pure? Why,
the very prayers in which we address Heaven
have their stiffening of self-concern, and it is
this that gives them their force. Are they
less acceptable on that account?</p>

<p class='c005'>Popular feeling was doubly stirred and
sympathy for the family greatly deepened by
the news of the almost simultaneous death of
Miss Arminell Inglett. The notice of her
death had appeared first in the <i>Times</i>, and
then in all the papers; but the circumstances
were only imperfectly known. It was rumoured
that the shock of the news of her
father’s death had affected her fatally—her
heart having always been weak—whilst in
London staying with her aunt. Such an
account had appeared in one of the society
papers, and perhaps Mr. Welsh could give
the best explanation of how it came there.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>This was reported at Orleigh. Others said
she had died at the second family place in
Northamptonshire; all agreed that she had
been buried there beside her mother.
Strange rumours had circulated about Miss
Inglett, but they had been traced to Mrs.
Cribbage, and every one knew that the
tongue of that lady, like that of an ox, must
be taken with salt. Consequently the rumours
died away, and were wholly discredited.</p>

<p class='c005'>And it was true that Arminell Inglett was
dead. That is to say, the old self-opinionated,
supercilious, self-willed Arminell was
no more.</p>

<p class='c005'>In spring the new buds are sheathed in
hard husks. One warm morning after a
shower they thrust aside these horny sheaths,
and the tender foliage appears. It was so
with Arminell. She had hitherto worn her
better part, the generous qualities of her
soul, in a hard and ungracious shell; now
this shell had fallen off, and they broke forth,
ready to expand and clothe her with a new
and unexpected beauty.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='c004'>Mr. James Welsh did all that was requisite
for the arrangement of Arminell’s money-matters.
She was entitled to her mother’s
dower, sufficient to maintain her in easy
circumstances. The settlement of her affairs
with the trustees, guardians, and the solicitors
of the family was a delicate transaction;
Arminell authorised Welsh to act for her,
and he managed with adroitness and tact,
without grudging time or trouble. Meanwhile
she remained an inmate of his villa in
the Avenue, Shepherd’s Bush. She did not
wish to be hasty in securing a house for herself
and engaging a companion. She would
not, however, encroach on the hospitality
of the Welshes, and she insisted on becoming
their lodger, paying them a moderate weekly
sum for her board. They were not rich,
their circumstances somewhat strait; it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>an object with Mrs. Welsh to save the penny
on the ’bus by walking to the railway arch;
and though, in their exuberant hospitality,
they would have cheerfully kept her as their
guest, and treated her to the best they could
afford, she insisted on their accepting her on
her own terms, not on theirs.</p>

<p class='c005'>Only by degrees did she realise to the full
extent what her social suicide implied. It
was not possible for her to estimate its costs
till she had committed the irrevocable act
which severed her from the world to which
she had belonged; as impossible, or almost
as impossible as it is for the girl who jumps
off London Bridge to conceive of the altered
relations and strangeness of the region into
which she will pass through the mud and
water of the Thames.</p>

<p class='c005'>I know that nothing surprised me more
as a child than being told that water was
composed of an infinite number of globules
arranged like pebbles in a bag; but the
stream of social life, which looks equally
simple and elemental, is in reality made not
only of the little component globules of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>individual life, but of a thousand other circles
enclosing these globules, all distinct, self-contained,
and rotating on their own axes
and taking their own courses. Each of these
circles has its special interests, its special
tittle-tattle, its special spites, and its special
ambitions. There are circles of all sorts,
professional, and social, and intellectual, and
those who pass from one to another have to
undergo mental adjustment before they can
understand the language and partake in the
momentum of these spheres. Such is the
parsonic circle, such the sporting circle, such
the circle of politicians, such the legal circle.
Let a hunter pitch his rider in pink over a
hedge into a ditchful of picnicing clergy and
their wives and daughters, and he will be as
unable to talk with them as they to entertain
him. Let Mrs. Brown drop through the
ceiling into an officers’ mess, and she will
not have a thought, a taste, a word in common.
Suffer an archbishop to rise through a
trap into the green-room of the ballet girls,
and what would they have in common?
The gods live on Olympus, mortals on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>plain, and the demons in Tartarus, and all
roll on together in one current. Dante divides
heaven into constellations, and purgatory into
mansions—all the blessed are separated by
leagues of ether, and all the lost by
adamantine walls. They do not associate,
the former enjoy themselves by themselves in
their cold planets and groups of stars, and the
latter stop in their several torments by themselves.
Their several virtues and several
vices classify them and separate them from
their fellows. It is not otherwise in this
world. We are all boxed off from each other,
and very uncomfortable when we step out of
our proper box into another.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell felt keenly the solitude of her
condition, and it weighed on her spirits. It was
not possible for her at once to accommodate
herself to her new surroundings. She had
Mrs. Welsh to talk, or rather to listen to, but
Mrs. Welsh had no other subjects of conversation
than the iniquities of servants and
the scandals in high life. According to Mrs.
Welsh, there was but one social circle in
which reigned virtue, and that was the circle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>of the middle class to which she belonged.
Servants as beneath that were bad, that her
daily experience taught her, and the upper
ten thousand, as she knew by the voice of
gossip and the revelations of the press, were
also corrupt. It is conceivable that one may
tire of hearing only two subjects discussed,
even though these subjects be of engrossing
interest; and Arminell was fatigued with the
relation of the misdeeds of domestics, and
the disorders of the nobility. Shylock said
to Antonio that he would talk with him, buy
with him, sell with him, but would not eat
with him. Arminell could do everything with
Mrs. Welsh except think with her. The
girl felt her friendless condition. She had no
companion of her own age, class, and sex,
to whom she could open her mind and of
whom ask counsel. She could have no more
communication with those in the upper world
to which she had belonged, and which shared
her intellectual and moral culture, than can a
fish have communication with the bird. It
looks up and sees the beautiful creatures
skimming the surface of its element, sees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>their feet moving in it, their beaks dipped
below it, but the birds do not belong to the
aqueous element, nor the fish to the
atmosphere, and they must live apart
accordingly. The bird can pull out a fish
and gobble it, and the fish can bite the toes
of the swimming duck, and that is the limit
of their association.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have heard of the case of a lady who was
either struck by lightning or so paralyzed by
electricity that she lay as one dead, bereft of
power of motion. She neither breathed nor
did her pulse beat, she could not move a
muscle or articulate a sound. She was pronounced
to be dead, and was measured,
shrouded, and put into her coffin. But
though apparently dead, she could hear all
that went on in the room, the blinds being
drawn down, the number of feet and inches
determined for her shell, the sobbing of her
mother, and the tramp of those who brought
in her coffin. She heard the undertaker ask
her father on the day of the funeral, whether
he should at once screw her down—then, by
a supreme effort she succeeded in flickering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>an eyelid, and her father saw the movement
and sent for a surgeon.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell was dead—dead to her relations,
to her friends, and to her acquaintance. They
discussed her, and she was unable to defend
herself. They wept over her, and she could
not dry their tears. She was incapacitated
by her own act from giving a token of life.
She was separated from every one with
whom for eighteen years she had associated,
cut off from every interest which for all these
years had occupied her mind, severed from
that stream of intellectual life in which she
had moved.</p>

<p class='c005'>She would not quiver an eye in entreaty
to be taken out of her shell, she had deliberately
gone into that chest, and to it she must
henceforth contract her interests and accommodate
her habits. When we die we carry
away nothing with us of our treasure, but we
have our friends and relatives to associate
with in the world of spirits; Arminell, by
her social death, had carried away with her
her patrimony, but that was all. She must make
new acquaintances, and acquire fresh friends.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>If there be any truth in the doctrine of the
transmigration of spirits, then the souls after
death enter into new existences, as dogs,
oxen, elephants, cockatoos, or earth-worms.
If so—the dog that fawns on us with such
speaking eyes may be the wife we still lament;
and when we cut a worm in two with our
spade, we may be slicing in half our little lost
babe; and the beef of the ox served at our
table may have been worn by the wandering
spirit of our most intimate friend.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are two considerations which make
me most reluctant to accept the doctrine
of transmigration—the one is that when we
leave our human frames and enter into those
of dog or slug, what wretchedness it will be
for us to adapt our minds and feelings to
doggish or sluggish limits. And the other is
that the distress must be insupportable to
associate with those with whom we have
lived without the power of communicating
with them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Arminell had transmigrated from the
aristocratic order of beings into the middle
class order of beings, and she had to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>accommodate her mind to the ways of this
lower grade; and although sitting on a bench
in Hyde Park, she might see those she had
known, talked to, loved, pass in Rotten Row,
she could no more communicate with them
than can those who have migrated into dog,
and cockatoo, and slug, communicate with us.</p>

<p class='c005'>In course of time, no doubt, she would find
congenial spirits, get to know and love nice
girls in this new circle in which she found
herself, but that would take time. In course
of time, no doubt, she would find her place in
this new order of life, be caught by its drift,
and drive forward with it. When we are in
a railway carriage and cast something from
the window, that object is carried on by the
momentum of the train, and does not drop
perpendicularly to the ground. So Arminell
in falling from her class was still for a while
sensible of its impulses, but this would cease
in time.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are cases known to science, in
which a person has fallen into a condition of
mental blank, has forgotten everything acquired,
and all acquaintances, and has to begin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>from the beginning again, to learn to
know the relations and to acquire speech and
every accomplishment. Now such a case
was not that of Arminell, for she remembered
all her past, nevertheless she had in
this new condition to accept as lost a vast
amount of what she had acquired in eighteen
years, and begin to accumulate afresh.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now—she was solitary. It had not occurred
to her in her former life that solitude could
be oppressive. Then she had counted it as
an escape from the whirl of social intercourse.
Then she had resented advice, and undervalued
sympathy; but now, when she was
deprived of these things, she felt the loss of
them. The wife transmigrated into a dog
may snap and bark, but cannot otherwise express
her heartache, and reproach her husband
when preparing for his second wife;
nor can the worm plead and look at us out of
our child’s blue eyes and tell us it is our own
little one translated, when we lift the spade
over it. So must Arminell remain silent and
unrecognised before all those who had loved
her and known her in her first existence.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>The life she led in the Avenue, Shepherd’s
Bush, was so unlike what she had been
accustomed to that it was not possible for her
to fit herself to it all at once. But Arminell
had good sense, and a brave spirit. She did
not waste her energies on vain repining.
She did not recoil from and disparage that
life into which she had entered. She accepted
it, as she had accepted the revelation
of her folly.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is a serviceable Yorkshire word,
descriptive of accommodation to circumstances,
which is worthy of being rescued
from a provincialism and of elevation into
general acceptance, and that word is—to
frame.</p>

<p class='c005'>A raw country girl is taken into a household
as servant. If she shows token of
adaptability to the situation, teachableness,
and willingness, she is said to frame.</p>

<p class='c005'>A clerk settles into an office, is quick in
acquiring the technicalities of the business, is
interested in his work, obliging as to extension
of hours under pressure, and he is said
by his employers to frame.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>A newly-married couple, if they make
allowances for each other’s weaknesses, are
not self-willed and unyielding, if ready to
make the best of all circumstances, are said
also to frame.</p>

<p class='c005'>The frame is the situation, and it may be
of all kinds, plain or rich, narrow or wide;
it may be guilt and burnished, or of rude
cross-pieces of oak. Into this frame the new
life, like a picture, has to be fitted, so much
of margin has to be shorn off, or so much of
mount has to be added. The frame will not
accommodate itself to the picture, the picture
must be adapted to the frame.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell was in the process of framing,
and the frame was one of her own selection.
Whether suitable or not, the situation could
not be adapted to her, she must adapt herself
to it; she must cut away here, and piece
on there to fit it. The reader shall be shown
some instances of the way in which Arminell
progressed with her framing.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the first place, the girl had been accustomed
all her life to having a lady’s-maid in
attendance on her, and putting to rights
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>everything she left in disorder. When she
changed her dress, she had been accustomed
to throw her clothes about just where she had
taken them off; she had not put her gloves
away, tidied her dressing-table, arranged her
dresses in the drawers. When, at first, she
came to the Avenue, she did as she had been
wont, and was unable to understand the
hints thrown out by her hostess that the
maid had too much of household work to do
to be able to act as a lady’s-maid as well.
Then Arminell discovered that it engaged
Mrs. Welsh half-an-hour in the morning,
another half-hour in the afternoon, and a
third in the evening, to arrange her clothes
and room. And as she was aware that Mrs.
Welsh had no cook, and had to superintend
the cooking herself, this imposed on her
hostess an extra and arduous task. Mrs.
Welsh expected before long to be a mother,
and to accumulate work on the good woman
at such a time was unjustifiable.</p>

<p class='c005'>Accordingly Arminell began to put her
room to rights herself, learned how to fold
her gowns, and liked to arrange her boots
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>tidily under the dressing-table, and put her
towels straight on the horse, and the comb
on the brush. After a week she found that
the trouble she gave herself was very slight,
and that it afforded her real pleasure to be
her own lady’s-maid.</p>

<p class='c005'>That was one item in the framing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Welsh had not much plate. Arminell
was not particular about what she ate,
but she was accustomed to silver and glass,
kept very bright, and to unchipped and
pretty china. The plate of the Welsh establishment
was electro-plate, and the plating
was somewhat abraded. The forks and
spoons were scratched, not polished. If an
egg had been eaten at breakfast, it was not
impossible to identify at dinner the spoon
that had been used for the egg. Even
Castle E claret was not attractive when the
bowl of the wine-glass bore on it the impress
of a thumb.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day Arminell said to Mrs. Welsh, “I
am sure that the girl is overworked. Shall I
give a final burnish to the silver and glass
before they come on table?” And Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Welsh had joyfully assented. So Arminell
began to take a pride and find a pleasure in
being butler in the house of Welsh.</p>

<p class='c005'>That was another item in the framing.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day Mrs. Welsh threw out mysterious
hints about the anticipated addition to the
family, and lamented that, owing to her
being without a cook, she had been unable
to provide the many articles of clothing
which a new-comer into the world expects
and exacts, to wit:—six long night-dresses,
half-a-dozen flannels, six shirts, the same
number of little socks, bibs to the number of
one dozen, besides other articles which for
brevity we will include under an &amp;c. What
would little Welsh do without his trousseau?</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Arminell went out and bought linen
and flannel, and horrocks, and began to cut
out and sew, and mark, and then hold up the
little garments and laugh and dance round
them, and find a pleasure and pride in being
a sempstress.</p>

<p class='c005'>That was another item in the framing.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a couple of weeks, Mrs. Welsh was
unable to further superintend the cooking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>The heat of the kitchen made her faint, and
the girl, when left to her own devices, devised
startling effects, quite Wagnerian,
Doréish.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Arminell began diligently to study
“Mrs. Warne’s Cookery Book,” and descend
to the subareal world and direct the proportions
of condiments, the rolling of pastry, the
mincing of veal, and the stuffing of geese.
Mrs. Welsh had had a limited culinary horizon—beef
olives, rissoles, haricot, were the
changes on joint, and the puddings were
ground rice mould, “shape” Mrs. Welsh
called it, rice milk and apple-tart. Arminell
extended the range, and was pleased to surprise
and delight Mr. Welsh, when he returned
fagged in the evening, with a dinner
that was a pleasure to eat. In a word, she
found a gratification and pride in being
cook.</p>

<p class='c005'>That was another item in the framing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Later, a little Welsh appeared on the
scene, and the monthly nurse appeared simultaneously.
It really seemed as if Mrs.
Welsh had been brought to bed of two babies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>for the nurse was as helpless as the infant.
She could, or would, neither dust the patient’s
room, nor lay a fire, nor put a match to the
fire when laid for her. She was incapable of
carrying upstairs a cup of tea or bowl of
gruel. It was hard to say which of the two
babies was the most incapable, exacting,
fractious, and insatiable. The maid-of-all-work
lost what little head she had, and her
temper went along with her head. When,
finally, it became clear that the corpulent,
middle-aged baby drank something stronger
than milk, Arminell asked to have her dismissed,
and undertook to attend to Mrs.
Welsh and the baby for the remaining fortnight.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus Arminell fell into the position of a
nurse.</p>

<p class='c005'>That was another item in the framing.</p>

<p class='c005'>But there were other adjustments went to
the framing. Arminell’s superciliousness,
her pride of intellect, her self-will, required
much paring down. Formerly she had
treated what was common-place and humdrum
with contempt as beneath the regard of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>one gifted with intelligence. Now she began
to acknowledge that it was in the
fulfilment of humdrum duties, and in the
accomplishment of common-place obligations
that the dignity and heroism of life lay.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell had been accustomed to criticise
severely those with whom she associated,
and to laugh at their weaknesses; and now
she had learned her own weakness, the
disposition to laugh at others had departed
from her, and was replaced by great forbearance.</p>

<p class='c005'>She began to wonder whether the regeneration
of society was to be effected by revolutionary
methods, and was not best
accomplished by the slow processes of
leavening with human charity.</p>

<p class='c005'>How often had she supposed that happiness
was impossible apart from the amenities
of life, that in the middle class, with its imperfect
culture and narrow aims, there could
be no true felicity; that in the lowest classes,
where there was no refinement of taste, no
polish of mind, no discipline of intellect, life
must be insupportable in its wretchedness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>But now she saw that happiness was of
general distribution and was not to be
arrogated as a prerogative of one class
alone, that, indeed, it seemed to lose its
freshness, its gaiety in proportion as knowledge
increased and culture advanced. The
two Welshes were happy; James happy in
his work of furious onslaught against aristocracy,
Tryphœna happy in the little sphere
of household duties, and supremely happy in
giving food to her baby. Not only so, but
the slave, the maid-of-all-work, was happy
down the area, and sang over her drudgery.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Arminell recalled the game she had
played as a child with her companions in a
circle, holding a string with a gold ring
threaded on it. One child stood in the
centre and tried to discover who had the ring,
and the ring passed about the living hoop,
and there was no hand under which the ring
might not be found. It was the same with
the round game of life. The gold ring of
happiness was not retained by those in gay
clothing, nor to be found only under the taper
fingers and in the delicate palms, as often it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>slipped under the broad flat hands of
those in washing calico gowns, and quite as
often was retained by the laughing rogues in
rags, whose rough hands were begrimed with
dirt.</p>

<p class='c005'>Consequently Arminell’s ideas on this
point, as on many another, underwent radical
change. This also went towards the framing.
Arminell’s manner changed. Her impatience
was replaced by gentleness and consideration
for others. Instead of her thoughts radiating
from and reverting to self, they played about
others, to the forgetfulness of self.</p>

<p class='c005'>An underlying sadness never deserted her,
but never intruded on notice. She constrained
herself to be cheerful, and its presence
was only revealed by great sweetness
of disposition. She took interest in what
interested others, and did not force on others
interest in her own concerns.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are frames ready-made for all of us.
It falls to the lot of an exceptional few to have
frames made to fit them. Some of us make
frames for ourselves, and as we always over-estimate
our size such frames are never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>suitable. As we cannot expand or contract
our frames to our liking, we must do the
other thing, stretch and shape our pictures
to them. I have seen coloured sketches on
an elastic material capable of being extended
indefinitely. Well for us if our life’s picture
be painted on such accommodating material.</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>The house at Chillacot had been temporarily
repaired, and made habitable, so that Jingles
and his mother could occupy it; but the
young man shortly after the death of his reputed
father entered into negotiations with
the railway company for the sale of the place.
His mother was shaken by what had occurred.
She had been threatened with
paralysis, and her speech affected for a few
days; but she speedily recovered activity of
tongue. There was now nothing in Orleigh
to retain the Saltrens. The mother had
never liked the dismal house, it was not
grand enough to meet her ideas, for was she
not the sister of a gentleman of the press, a
man who was certain, according to her
account, to contest that division of the county
in the Radical interest at the next election?
She resolved to settle in London. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>she would be able to assume more consequence
than where she and her antecedents
were well known. But Mrs. Saltren laid
down to her son that it was not to any part
of London she would go. She must have a
house in the West End—her brother, she
said, lived in the West End. There was no
qualifying S. before or C. after the W. on his
address. Those persons who lived in S. W.
or W. C. <i>might</i> be gentlemen, those who
lived in division W. <i>were</i> gentlemen. As
certain estates in Austria ennoble their purchasers,
so did living in the W. quarter of
town elevate socially. At Orleigh Mrs.
Saltren could not aspire to occupy such a
position as that which her fancy pictured herself
as adorning in town. There she could
figure as the widow of a captain; at Orleigh
it was known too well that the captaincy of
her husband had been over a gang of miners.</p>

<p class='c005'>The sale of Chillacot would enable her to
spend more money than was usually at her
command, and she talked grandly of having
a carriage and a button-boy. At Orleigh she
could not speak as freely of her acquaintance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>with the Lamerton family as she could elsewhere,
for at Orleigh it was known that her
situation at the Park had been a menial one.
The railway company paid liberally for
Chillacot, but not so liberally as Mrs. Saltren
figured to herself, nor was the capital thus
acquired likely to cover all the expenditure
which she flattered herself she would be able
to launch forth into.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marianne Saltren had exercised sufficient
discretion to hold her tongue about her husband’s
concern in the death of Lord Lamerton,
but she was sufficiently aware of her own
frailty to doubt whether she could retain the
secret for ever among confidential friends,
and she knew that to trust an intimate friend
with a secret was the way to publish it to the
world. Anxiety lest she should be betrayed
into communicating what had better remain
unknown acted strongly upon her to make
her desire to leave Orleigh speedily.</p>

<p class='c005'>The young man, moreover, had no wish to
stay in a place which was associated in his
mind with too many painful and humiliating
recollections. It would not be possible for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>him there to escape meeting Lady Lamerton
and little Giles, and such encounters must be
productive of distress to her ladyship and
embarrassment to himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>At Orleigh moreover, there were no means
of his earning for himself a livelihood. His
mother was welcome, in his eyes, to spend
the money derived from the sale, money to
which he had, he felt, a legal but no moral
right. The captain was not his father, therefore
he did not consider himself entitled to
what he left.</p>

<p class='c005'>The desire to make his way in literature
had deserted him under the rebuff received
from Mr. Welsh, and his self-confidence had
not recovered the blow it had been given to
make him feel himself qualified to act as
political teacher of men.</p>

<p class='c005'>He resolved on taking a clerkship in an
office. His pride was gone. So long as he
could earn enough to support himself and his
mother, he did not care in what sort of business
he made the money, so long as it was
fairly and honourably earned.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the day approached on which it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>arranged that he and his mother should leave
Chillacot, Saltren’s heart sank; but not so
that of his mother. She became more talkative
and more boastful. Only since he had
discovered how false she had been in the
story of his parentage, had his eyes been open
to her unreliability. Hitherto he had looked
up to her with respect. He had never felt
much tenderness towards old Saltren, and his
mother by her complaints had bred in him
antagonism towards his father as if he were a
man who misunderstood his mother and
failed to show her the love and regard she
deserved. There are heads like those of
thistles, that are full of feather-light, mischievous
thoughts, which are blown about the
country and in proper soil germinate and
produce a crop of weeds. Such was the
head of Marianne Saltren, but Jingles was
sufficiently humbled to acknowledge that unless
his own heart had proved suitable soil,
rich in self-conceit, these thistle-down fancies
would not have rooted.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Saltren’s acquaintances called to say
farewell, and before them her boasting was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>so ridiculous that it covered her son with
shame. He knew what the circumstances of
James Welsh were, and what the position
was that he occupied in town.</p>

<p class='c005'>Young Saltren hesitated for some days
how to act towards Lady Lamerton. Should
he call and bid her farewell, or should he
forbear? To both a meeting must be
painful. If he considered his natural shrinking
from an unpleasant scene, he would desist
from paying her his respects; but his conscience
told him that to depart without an
apology and a word of explanation would be
ungenerous. Accordingly, on his last day at
Chillacot, he walked over to the Park, and
asked to see her ladyship. Lady Lamerton
was engaged at the moment with some ladies
who had called to pay their condolence, so at
his request he was shown into the library;
and the butler undertook to inform her ladyship
that he was there, as soon as she was
free from her visitors.</p>

<p class='c005'>As he sat in the familiar room, he mused
on what he had to say. The situation was
peculiar, as it was difficult. Lady Lamerton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>knew nothing, he supposed, and need know
nothing, about the mistake he had made
concerning his parentage. He could not tell
her the story which he and Arminell had
believed, and on which they had acted, yet
without this key to their conduct it was
hardly possible to explain it—to justify it
even with the key was impossible.</p>

<p class='c005'>As Jingles sat in the study meditating, the
door opened slightly, and little Giles’s face
appeared at it. The moment he saw his old
tutor he uttered an exclamation of delight,
and ran to him. “Mr. Saltren, why have you
left me?” he asked: “my dear papa is dead,
and I am so unhappy. Why do you not
come back to us? and Arminell is dead also.
I have no one here but mamma. I love
mamma, but I want you also.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jingles took the little boy on his knee.
The child had a delicate, intelligent face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did you hear that I had arrived?” asked
Saltren.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No; I looked into the library because—I
really can hardly say why. Since I have
lost papa, I go all about the house; I know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>I cannot find him, but I cannot help running
into one room and then another seeking him.
I heard the study door open, and that was
papa’s room, and I thought—that is—I didn’t
think—I wondered who could be in papa’s
room. I was fond of coming here and sitting
on his lap and hearing about his rides and
his spills when foxhunting. Whenever I
hear a door open or a step on the stairs, I
think papa is coming, and then next moment
I know it cannot be so. Why do you not
come back? I am doing no lessons now,
and am tired of holiday.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are going to school shortly,
Giles.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I know, but not till the term begins.
Nurse says that I am my lord now, and that
mamma will call me Lamerton instead of
Giles. But I don’t like it. I don’t wish to
take anything that was papa’s. I always
persuade myself he will come back. Did
they tell you that I saw a black coach come
to the door and carry away papa? The
black coach never came for Arminell. When
I saw that, papa would not let me tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>mamma lest it should frighten her. Why
was not Arminell buried in the vault?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you had any of your bad dreams
lately?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, sir, but two nights ago I thought
that papa came to my crib side and kissed
me. I did not see, but I felt him; and he
put his hand on my head and stroked my
hair, exactly the same way he did that night
when I had my bad dreams and saw the
black coach and screamed. I know papa’s
kiss even when I do not hear him speak, and
also the touch of his hand, which is not
heavy, but very light. I told nurse about it
in the night, after he was gone, but she said
it was all stuff and nonsense, and I must go
to sleep. There comes mamma.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The boy jumped off his tutor’s knee and
stood aside. He had been brought up to
old-fashioned courtesy, and never remained
seated when his mother entered the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton bowed stiffly to Jingles.
She was dressed in the deepest mourning,
and looked pale and delicate. At a sign
from her the little fellow withdrew. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>indicated a chair, but Saltren, who had risen,
did not reseat himself. She did not speak,
but waited for what he had to say, and she
remained standing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My lady,” said the young man, “my
conscience would not suffer me to depart,
probably never again to revisit Orleigh, without
coming here to express to you in few
words what I feel in every fibre of my heart.
I know how much I owe you, my lady,—to
your forbearance and kindness towards a”—he
hesitated a moment, and then said the
word firmly—“towards a Prig. I have not
the words at my command in which even to
allude to the debt I owe to one who——”</p>

<p class='c005'>She bowed her head, she understood to
whom he referred. His voice refused to
proceed with the sentence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have come, my lady, in the first place
to tell you that never, while life lasts, will I
forget what I owe to you and to his lordship.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is a pity”—she began, and then
checked herself; but a faint colour came into
her lips, a flush of anger at the recollection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>of how he had repaid the kindness shown
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jingles waited for her to finish the sentence,
but as she did not do so, he said, “It
is a pity I did not remember this earlier.
Yes, that I now admit, to my indelible shame.
I acted most ungratefully. I do not know,
my lady, what Miss Inglett has told you, and
therefore I am placed in a difficulty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She has told me everything,” answered
Lady Lamerton, “at least so I suppose.
Here is her letter to me, which you are at
liberty to peruse, and you will see by it if
there is anything kept back which ought to
be told, or which you wish to tell me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She extended a note to him, and he took
it, and ran his eye through it. It was written
in Arminell’s firm hand, and it told everything,
in her plain, decisive, and direct manner—she
hid nothing, she excused nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>He returned the letter to Lady Lamerton.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is but one thing for me to add—or
rather,” said he, “one correction for me
to make. Miss Inglett takes the blame on
herself. It should rest mainly on my shoulders.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Without my offer of help she never
would have left this house. I have no word
of self-excuse. No one can reproach me
more severely than I reproach myself. In
no eyes can I figure more despicably than in
my own. That is all I have to say—to
assure you of my gratitude and my regret.
I thank you, Lady Lamerton, that you have
permitted me to see you and say this.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Saltren,” said she, “I will not disguise
the fact that you—you and my step-daughter
between you—have occasioned me
more grief than has even the death of my
dear lord. But I am not justified in refusing
to accept your expression of sorrow, though
perhaps it is too early yet, and the wound
too fresh, for me to be able heartily to forgive
you both. I acknowledge that you
acted for the best when you discovered your
error, in returning promptly to Chillacot, so
as to silence the voice of scandal. Whether
Arminell was wise in acting as she did admits
of difference of opinion. For her decision
you are not responsible. She tells me what
you proposed—to telegraph for her maid to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>sent to Portland Place, and that the maid
should find her at her aunt’s and accompany
her home. If that plan had been executed,
only ourselves would have known the secret
history of that London escapade. But she
elected otherwise. She would punish herself
for having thought unworthily of her dear
father, and for having embittered his last
hour of life. It is possible, indeed it is
probable, that it was the distress and alarm
which he felt, as he took that fatal walk, that
blinded him as to his course, so that he fell
over the cliff. I dare say Arminell has
judged right in resolving to suffer. I do not
blame her. There is something honourable
in her resolve to abide the consequences of
her own foolish act. She has also spared
me the difficulty of meeting her under the
circumstances, and controlling and disguising
my feelings towards her. If we had met immediately,
I hardly know how I could have
behaved with composure and charity towards
her. I never, never could have loved her as
I have loved her heretofore; for I could not
have forgotten the dishonour she had done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>in thought to the purest life, the noblest soul——”
Then her ladyship broke down.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a minute she recovered herself, and
proceeded, “She has foreseen this, and has
resolved to relieve me of the restraint, to
spare me the trial. I thank her for that. I
confess, Mr. Saltren, that when I heard you
were here my first impulse was to decline an
interview. But on second thoughts I resolved
to accord you a meeting. It is as well
that no one should suspect the wrong you
have done; and it is right that I should
accept your expression of penitence, for we
daily ask of Heaven to forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive such as have trespassed
against us.” She paused.</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren’s heart was too full for him to
speak.</p>

<p class='c005'>Silence ensued for a minute or two. Each
stood, each with lowered eyes, and with a
struggle raging in each for control over the
stirred emotions.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will say good-bye,” said her ladyship,
“no doubt for ever. After what has passed
it is as well that we should never meet again.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>I am glad that you have called. I am glad
that I have received you. I shall think of
you henceforth more kindly, in the light of
one who, having done wrong, devotes the
rest of his life to striving to do his duty.
Mr. Saltren, our feelings must not be allowed
to guide us, but principle.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Giles Inglett Saltren walked home much
depressed, and yet content that he had seen
Lady Lamerton; depressed because he had
seen her and Giles for the last time, and content
because he had done right in seeking the
interview.</p>

<p class='c005'>He felt now that he had thrown away an
opportunity of in some little way repaying
Lady Lamerton for the kindness shown him.
But for his mistake he might at this time
have rendered her valuable aid, such as, in a
time of confusion consequent on the fall of
the main pillar of a house, must always occur.
He might have been of use to her in a thousand
little ways, knowing as he did the ramifications
of life in the great house; of use also
now with the boy in giving vent to his fresh
and pliable character.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>A remarkable difference is found to exist
between the stages of development in the
physical and moral natures. The insect
passes through three degrees, the larva, the
pupa, and imago, the last phase being the
noblest, and the middle the most torpid of
the three conditions. With man and woman
physically it is different. The childhood indeed
corresponds to the grub stage, but this
is immediately followed by the butterfly condition,
and that of cessation of energies and
deterioration of beauty follows as the third
period. In psychical development, however,
man follows the same course as the insect.
After the first voracious acquisitive period of
growth, comes the pupa condition, when the
human conscience, glutted with as much
knowledge and experience as it deems sufficient,
encases itself in a chrysalis of conceit,
and falls asleep in self-sufficiency. Then,
after a period of comatosity, comes a shock
of awakening life, the breath of a new spirit
passes over the earth, the sun smites with
provocative ray, and the sleeping soul
stretches itself, and suddenly finds its case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>too strait for it. Then that horny hide of
self-conceit is riven from top to bottom, and
falls away, and at length the true, the perfect
spiritual character comes forth, flutters its
wings for a moment, gains fresh courage and
expands them. It is indeed true that some
insects never escape out of their chrysalis,
and some birds stifle in their shells through
lack of force to rive the encasing bound.
And it is also true that there are men and
women who to the last remain hide-bound in
their self-esteem; and the moral sense, the
spiritual force, the power of development becomes
extinct in them.</p>

<p class='c005'>In our gardens the spade occasionally
brings up these dead pupæ in their horny
coffins; and we are continually coming
across human beings in society, in like manner
enchrysalised in conceit, in which they
remain eternally encoffined.</p>

<p class='c005'>It must not be supposed that the transition
condition is without its throes and effort.
On the contrary, the advance to the better,
the perfect life is only possible through effort,
and the effort is stimulated by the sense of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>oppression, through realisation of the straitness
of the shell.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hard had been the case that enclosed
Jingles, but the Giles Inglett Saltren we now
see had completely emancipated himself from
it.</p>

<p class='c005'>When he opened the door of Chillacot, his
mother said—“Giles, I have secured a
servant. I have promised Tamsine Kite a
place in my establishment as lady’s-maid.
She will attend me to town.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, mother—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear, it is settled; and see, here is
Captain Tubb.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Captain Tubb!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, he has come to pay me his respects
before I leave, and to congratulate me on the
disposal of Chillacot for so handsome a sum,
and to enquire what I propose doing with
the money—and even to suggest a desirable
investment for it.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>Saltren moved with his mother to London,
and went with her into lodgings. Mrs.
Saltren had insisted on taking Thomasine
with her, and incurred accordingly the
additional expense of maintaining her where
she was not wanted. Thomasine was not
likely to be of use till the Saltrens got a house
of their own, and Giles did not choose to take
one till he had got into a situation and was
able to see what his prospects were likely to
be. As lady’s-maid to Mrs. Saltren, Thomasine
was, of course, no good at all, or likely,
to employ that serviceable Yorkshire word
again, “to frame” as one.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whatever you do,” said Mrs. Saltren,
“mind that we live in the West End. Why
don’t you go to Shepherd’s Bush, near the
Welshes? A man of my brother’s political
and literary position must have hosts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>distinguished acquaintances, and a woman
of Tryphœna’s accomplishments and beauty
must have the <i>entrée</i> into the highest circles.
If we lived near them we might get good
introductions. If we don’t get settled to my
liking shortly in a fashionable quarter of town,
I do not know but that I may return to
Orleigh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Return to Orleigh!” echoed the son,
“why, mother, I thought that your desire
had been to leave it. Besides, we have not
a house there any more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know we have not,” answered his
mother, “but what <i>we</i> may be without, it is
possible that <i>I</i> might secure.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not understand,” said Jingles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think,” said Mrs. Saltren, “that it is
proper the money paid by the railway company
for Chillacot should be put into the bank
in my name and not in yours.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have already told you, mother,” said
Giles, “that I will not touch it myself. I
consider it yours, not mine.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I have not the disposal of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed, mother, you have; it is entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>in your name, not in mine, already. I have
no account at the bank at all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How can you talk nonsense,” said Mrs.
Saltren; “you have all your savings—quite
a fortune—which you got at the Park whilst
tutor to young Giles.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear mother, I had not the time to
accumulate a fortune. I was tutor there for
eighteen months and what I saved was a
hundred and twenty-five pounds, and that
sum is already disposed of.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Disposed of! What have you done with
it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have purchased an annuity for some
one.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“For whom? for me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, mother, not for you. You have the
purchase money of Chillacot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“For whom then? I insist on knowing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“For a man who has been crippled, and is
unable to earn his livelihood.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What nonsense! What absurd fit of
heroic charity has come over you? Since you
went to town in that strange, hurried fashion
at the time of your father’s death, you have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>been altered from what you were before, as
different as canister beef from that which
is fresh from the ox.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Giles said nothing in self-defence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I insist on knowing on whom you
have thrown this money away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not wish to tell—on a man who has
the nearest of claims on me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Saltren considered, then coloured,
looked mortified, and did not prosecute her
inquiries. “Well,” she said petulantly, “a
fool and his money is soon parted. I am
very glad I insisted on having the Chillacot
purchase money removed from your fingering.
Please to ring for my lady’s-maid.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lady’s-maid, mother?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“For Thomasine. I want to speak to her.
You may leave the room. Here we have
been in town a week and the Welshes have
not called. If we are to be more solitary
here than we were at Chillacot, I shall
go back to Orleigh. Ring for my lady’s-maid.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Saltren was, indeed, becoming tired
of London. Her opportunities for boasting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>were confined to talks with her landlady and
her landlady’s visitors.</p>

<p class='c005'>It did her soul good, said the woman of
the lodgings, to hear of lords and ladies; it
was as comforting and improving as the
words that dropped from the lips of the
Reverend Hezekiah Bumpas. She felt it
down to her toes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Saltren indulged her in this particular
to her heart’s content. She knew many
persons of distinction. Lady Hermione
Woodhead, who lived in Portland Place, had
once been her intimate friend, till they
differed about Lord Lamerton’s marriage.
What had made them differ? It did not become
her to speak, but his lordship had set
his affections elsewhere, she could not name
in what direction, and had been inveigled by
the Woodheads into an alliance with their
family. It was a mistake, an entanglement
managed by designing women.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton was ill after his engagement,
so was another person who must be
nameless. When Lady Lamerton died, then
his first flame had married—without love,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>and in his desperation he married again. Of
course after that first estrangement she and
Lady Hermione never spoke. She—Marianne
Saltren—had passed the Earl of
Anstey’s family repeatedly without recognition.
If her landlady doubted her word, let her
accompany her to Hyde Park, and when the
Anstey family drove by, she would see that
they took no notice of each other. After
what had happened it could not be otherwise.
But though Mrs. Saltren could talk what
nonsense came into her vain head to the
lodging-house keeper, she was disappointed
that she could not to a larger circle, disappointed
at the little notice she attracted in
town. It was most strange that the Welshes
took no notice of her. She feared that they
were going to treat her with coldness and
not introduce her to the distinguished circle
of acquaintances in which they moved.</p>

<p class='c005'>I knew a young girl who was given
lessons in oil-painting before she had learned
how to draw, and a somewhat similar inversion
of order went on in the instruction of
Thomasine Kite, whom Marianne Saltren
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>began to train to be a lady’s-maid before the
girl knew the elements of domestic service,
having previously been a farm-maid, feeding
pigs and scouring milk-pails.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thomasine did not take readily to instruction,
least of all could she acquire deference
towards her mistress; and Mrs. Saltren
was irritated at the freedom with which the
girl accosted her, and at the laughter she
provoked in Thomasine when she, Marianne,
assumed her grand manner. Moreover, she
discovered that her landlady had been questioning
the girl in private as to the circumstances
and former position of her mistress,
and Mrs. Saltren was afraid that the revelations
in the kitchen might cause some of her
stories to be discounted. Fortunately for
her, the broad dialect of Thomasine was
almost unintelligible to the landlady, and the
girl had the cunning of the uneducated, which
leads them to evade giving a direct answer
to any question put to them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Giles Inglett Saltren was unaware till he
came to town that Arminell was settled in the
house of the Welshes. He knew that his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>uncle had undertaken to arrange matters of
business for her, and to look out for a house
and companion for her, but he had refrained
from asking questions about her, from
motives of delicacy. Indeed, he had scarcely
written to Mr. Welsh since his return to
Orleigh. He was resolved not again to seek
his assistance on his own behalf, but to find
a situation for himself. When, however, he
came to town, and met his uncle at an office
in the city, he learned from him where
Arminell was, and at once urged on Mr.
Welsh the mischief which would ensue should
Mrs. Saltren discover that Miss Inglett was
alive and their lodger. Welsh saw that, and
undertook to prevent his wife from calling on
Mrs. Saltren, and promised to keep his eye
open for an opportunity of placing Arminell
elsewhere. Marianne Saltren shared the
prevailing opinion that Miss Inglett was dead
and Giles was specially anxious lest she
should discover that this was not the case.
If she were to see Arminell, would it be
possible to control her tongue? Would she
not be eager to publish the fact that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Honourable Miss Inglett was a guest of her
brother and sister-in-law?</p>

<p class='c005'>It had been Saltren’s intention to keep
away from Arminell, but under this alarm he
felt it his duty to see her and precipitate her
departure from Shepherd’s Bush. His mother
could not be kept indefinitely away from her
brother’s house. One word from his mother
might frustrate Arminell’s intention, upset her
plans. From Mrs. Saltren the report would
rapidly spread. Mrs. Cribbage had ears like
those of the trusty servant on the Winchester
escutcheon, and without the trusty servant’s
padlock on the tongue. If once the truth
got wind, to what difficulties would the
Lamerton family be put, now that they had
accepted and published the death of the girl!</p>

<p class='c005'>The author of this novel was involved
many years ago in an amateur performance
of “Macbeth,” but the sole part he took in
the tragedy was to sit in the midst of the
witches’ cauldron, and ignite the several
coloured fires which were destined to flame,
as scale of dragon, tooth of wolf, liver of
blaspheming Jew, were cast in. But when,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>to Locke’s lovely music, the imps and
witches danced around the vessel, then it
was his function to explode a so-called flower-pot,
which is a roaring, spirting composition
of fire-work. Unfortunately, at the first
chorus and circular dance, the blazing flower-pot
tumbled back upon the author, concealed
within the depths of the cauldron, and, to
save himself from an <i>auto-da-fé</i> end, he enveloped
the flower-pot in a rug, and screwed
it up tight and sat on it. So the scene
ended, and, believing that the fire-work was
completely extinguished, he then unfolded
the rug. No sooner, however, did the air
reach the smothered fire-work, than it
bounced, and roared, and blazed with doubled
vigour. It threw out sheaths of flame, it
shot off Roman candles, it ejected a score of
crackers, and filled the entire stage with
smoke, and very nearly burnt down the
theatre.</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren dreaded something of this sort
happening now. The fire-work of scandal
had, indeed, been muffled up and smothered,
when first it began to fizz; but—who could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>tell?—if it got air again, even through a pin-hole,
it would burst into furious conflagration
and defy all efforts made to suppress it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The writer of this story takes this occasion
of apologising—if apology be necessary—for
the introduction, on more than one occasion,
of his own adventures, his own opinions, and,
if you will it, his own prejudices into the
course of his narrative. He will be told that
the author should disappear as a personality,
just as the actor merges his individuality in
that of the character he represents. He
must treat himself as a flower-pot and wrap
himself up in the <i>garde-robe</i> of his <i>dramatis
personæ</i>. I might, of course, have told that
story of the flower-pot in the cauldron as
having happened to Jingles at Orleigh, but
then I could never have told that story again
at a dinner-party, for my guest, next but
one, would say, “Ah! that happened to my
brother, or to my uncle, or to an intimate
friend;” and how can I deny that Jingles
did not stand in one of these relations to him?</p>

<p class='c005'>Montaigne, the essayist, was a sad sinner
in the introduction of himself into his prose.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>The essay on which he was engaged might
be on the history of Virgil, or Julius Cæsar,
but there was certain to creep into it more
of Montaigne than of either. The younger
Scaliger rebuked him for it, and, after having
acquainted the world with the ancestry of
Montaigne, he adds, “His great fault is this,
that he must needs inform you, ‘For my
part I am a lover of white wines or red
wines.’ What the Devil signifies it to the
public,” adds Scaliger, “whether he is a lover
of white wines or red wines?” So, but with
more delicacy, and without the introduction
of that personage whose name has been
written with a capital D, the reader may say
to the author, What the blank does it signify
what you think, what you like, what you did,
whether you ever sat in a cauldron, whether
you ever had a flower-pot fall on your head,
whether you sought to extinguish it by sitting
on it?—go on with your story.</p>

<p class='c005'>But a man’s personality—I mean my own—is
like that piece of pyrotechnic contrivance,
a flower-pot. He wraps it up, he
smothers it under fold after fold of fiction;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>but, fizz! fizz! out it comes at last—here,
there, on all sides, and cannot be disguised.
There is, to be sure, that subterfuge, the use
of the first person plural in place of the first
person singular, but is it not more vainglorious
to talk of We, as if we were royalties,
instead of plain and modest I?</p>

<p class='c005'>When Giles Saltren arrived at the house
in the Avenue, Shepherd’s Bush, Arminell
flushed with pleasure, sprang from her seat,
and with outstretched hand started to receive
him; then she checked herself, and said,
“I am glad to see you. Oh, Mr. Saltren, I
hear nothing of Orleigh, of dear, dear Orleigh!
I have the heartache for news. I
want to hear my own tongue wag on the
subject nearest my heart, and to listen to
tidings about the people I knew there. I
am like a departed soul looking back on
familiar scenes, and unable to visit them and
old friends, and unable to communicate with
them. I am Dives, and Orleigh is to me
Paradise. You have come thence with a
drop of fresh news wherewith to cool my
thirsty tongue.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“I am Lazarus indeed,” said Saltren, “but
out of Paradise. Ask me what you will
about Orleigh, and I will answer what I can.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is one matter that teases me,” she
said; “I promised a poor fellow, before I left,
that he should have employment at a small
wage, and I do not suppose he has had what
I undertook to give him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you mean Samuel Ceely? He is
provided for.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How so?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He has come in, unexpectedly, for a little
money, wherewith an annuity has been purchased.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am glad of that. And—my mother
and Giles, have you seen them?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I called to say farewell to both.
Lady Lamerton looks worn and sad, and
your dear brother is out of spirits; but this
could not be otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell’s eyes filled, and she went to the
window and dried her tears.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Inglett,” said the young man, after
she had been given time to recover herself, “I
have only ventured to call on you for one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>reason, that I might impress on you the
necessity of leaving this house. My mother
is in town, and she must not be allowed to
know or even suspect that you are alive and
here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell did not speak for some time.
Presently she said, “Do not let us talk about
anything at present but Orleigh. I am
parched for news. I daresay there is nothing
of tremendous importance to relate, but I
care for little details. How was the house
looking? Were the trees turning to their
autumn tints? The Virginian creeper, was
that touched with crimson? How are Mr.
and Mrs. Macduff? I could not abide them
when I was at Orleigh; I could be thankful
now for a sound of their delightful Scotch
brogue. What is Giles going to do? dear
little boy! I would give a week’s sunlight for
a kiss from his moist lips—which formerly I
objected to. And mamma—has she been to
the Sunday School since—since—?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Arminell’s tears flowed again.</p>

<p class='c005'>After another pause, during which the
young man looked through the photographic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>album on the table, Arminell recovered herself,
and said, “Do not suppose for a moment
that I regret my decision. My conscience is
relieved. I am beginning to acquire fresh
interests. I am now making a frock for
baby. I am godmother to Mrs. Welsh’s
child, and have come to be very fond of him.
But there—tell me something about Orleigh,
and Giles, and my mother—about any person
or animal, or shrub or tree there. And, oh!
can you obtain for me some photographs of
the place? I should cherish them above
everything I have. I dream of Orleigh. I
think of Orleigh, and—I shall never see dear
Orleigh again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will come another day, Miss Inglett,
and tell you all that I can, but to-day I must
urge on you the vital necessity of at once
leaving this house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your aunt can hardly get on without
me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She managed formerly without you, she
must do the same again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But there was no baby in the house then.
And, besides, the new cook who was to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>come has failed. The last went up a ladder
sixty feet high, and it took several constables
and a sergeant to get her down.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell laughed through her tears.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Inglett, consider what the difficulty
would be in which her ladyship would be
placed should it become known—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mrs. Saltren and her lady’s-maid!”</p>

<p class='c005'>The door was thrown open by the maid of-all-work,
and she ushered into the drawing-room
the person of all others—except perhaps
Mrs. Cribbage—whom it was desired to keep
from the house, and she was followed by
Thomasine Kite.</p>

<p class='c005'>Verily, the flower-pot was not smothered.
It was about to fizz and puff again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XLVII.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>EQUILIBRIUM.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The story is told of a mouse having been
hidden under a dish-cover, and a married pair
introduced into the dining-room and invited
to partake of every dish except that which
remained covered. When left to themselves,
the woman, contrary to the advice of her
husband, raised the cover, and out ran the
mouse. Blue Beard forbade Fatima to open
one door in his castle, and of course she tried
the forbidden key. There was one tree in
the midst of Paradise of which our first
parents were not allowed to eat, and of
course they nibbled at the fruit to discover
how it tasted. All these stories point to the
truth that nothing can be retained from
human inquisitiveness. A secret resembles a
mouse more than an apple or a dead wife of
Blue Beard, for the mouse escapes when
once uncovered and can no more be hidden,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>whereas the apple disappears when eaten,
and the dead woman is locked up again. A
secret when once out is all over the house,
and is far too wary to be trapped again.</p>

<p class='c005'>Who would expect to find a mouse under
a dish-cover? So with secrets, they are let
loose from the most unlikely places, and
many of us know that so well that we devote
our energies to, and spend our time in lifting
china cups, opening snuff-boxes, removing
lids of tea caddies, unsnapping purses, pulling
out drawers, boring holes in casks, in the
hopes of letting out secrets. We suspect our
acquaintance and “visit” their goods, as if
we were custom-house officers in search of
what is contraband. We know that they
have a forbidden secret somewhere, and we
search and probe everywhere to discover it.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are mice everywhere; if we hold
our breath and remain still for two minutes
we can hear them scratching and squeaking;
and there are secrets everywhere, behind the
wainscot, under the floor, in the cupboard.
Once I knew of a nest of mice in a gentleman’s
boot, and once in a lady’s muff; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>secrets nest and breed in quite as extraordinary
places—in a pocket, in a bunch of
flowers, in envelopes, under pillows.</p>

<p class='c005'>Æsop tells of a beautiful cat that was
transformed into a woman, but this woman
could never forget her feline instinct to run
after a mouse. A great many ladies I know
have the same feline instinct to spring out
of bed, up from their sofas, to make a dart
after a secret, if they hear but the slightest
footsteps, see but a whisker. I do not blame
them. Men are sportsmen, why should not
women be mousers? We find pleasure in
starting a hare, why should not a woman find
as much in starting a couching secret?</p>

<p class='c005'>I do not blame them for their love of sport,
but for what they do with their game when
it is caught. We bag ours, they let theirs
run. Samson did the same. He caught
foxes and tied firebrands to their tails and
sent them into the standing corn of the
Philistines. Our secret-hunters, when they
have caught their game, tie brimstone
matches to their tails and send them among
the stores of their neighbours.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>I do not believe in the possibility of concealing
secrets, and therefore never try to
keep them. As for pursuing a secret when
once out, that is labour in vain, it changes
form, it doubles, it dives, it has as many artifices
as a chased fox. As soon recover a secret
as recondense volatile essential oils that have
been spilt. A secret is not safe in our own
heads, for our heads are of amber, and the
secret is visible to every one who looks at us,
like a congealed fly therein.</p>

<p class='c005'>In one of the Arabian Nights’ Tales a
princess goes after a necromancer who has
transformed himself into a scorpion, and she
takes the shape of a serpent; the wizard,
hard pressed, becomes a cat, and the princess
attacks him in the disguise of a wolf. Then
the cat becomes a seed, and the wolf a cock,
thereat the seed falls into a canal and is
transmuted into a trout, which is at once
chased by the princess in shape of a pike.
Finally both issue in flames from the water,
the wizard is reduced to ashes, but so also is
the princess. If we try to overtake and
make an end of a secret, we shall meet with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>less success than did this princess. She at
last succeeded in destroying her game, but
we, in our efforts to catch and make an end
of an unpleasant secret, get set on flames
ourselves. If we have anything we do not
want our neighbours to know, and it has got
out, we had better let it run; we cannot recover
it. Indeed I believe that the best way
to conceal what we do not want to have
known is to expose it for sale, to dangle it
before the eyes of every one, like those men
outside the Exchange who offer spiders at
the end of threads of elastic for one penny.
Nobody buys. No one even looks at them.
But were one of these fellows to hide such a
black putty spider in his hat, up his arm, in
his pocket, a crowd would collect and pull
him to pieces to find the spider.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was not immediately that Arminell
realised the serious consequences of Mrs.
Saltren’s visit, but the young man knew at
once that all chance of the secret being respected
was at an end.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am interrupting,” said the widow,
knowingly, “I am sure I hadn’t the wish. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>came to see Mrs. Welsh, and never expected
to find my son here, much less Miss Inglett.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mrs. Welsh is upstairs with the baby,”
said Arminell. “You have not seen your
nephew. Shall I fetch him, Mrs. Saltren?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not for the world, Miss Inglett. I will
run upstairs and find my sister-in-law, who,
I do say, has been negligent in calling on me.
But if the mountain won’t go to Mahomet,
Mahomet must go to the mountain. I’m
sure I don’t want to intrude here. You may
leave the room, Thomasine, I don’t want
you to follow me up to the nursery. Go
down to the kitchen. Every one ought to
know her own place.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When the girl had disappeared, Mrs.
Saltren said confidentially, “We brought the
young person to town, and she don’t understand
how to friz the hair, and me wanting to
wear a fringe. However she could have had
the face to offer for my situation as lady’s-maid,
passes my understanding. But, Miss,
the conceit of the rising generation is surprising.
I want to ask Mrs. Welsh to take
the creature off my hands in any capacity she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>likes to name. She might do as parlour-maid,
or nurse-girl, or cook, anything but
lady’s-maid. I’ve tried to teach her to fold
gowns, but folding is like music or painting—you
must be born with the gift; it cannot
be learnt; and as some have no ear for tune,
and others no eye for colour, so have some
no natural gift for folding. You can’t make,
as they say, a fichu out of a bustle. I had
once a red flannel coverlet, and a hole was
burnt in it, so I turned it into a petticoat.
When the hot weather came I couldn’t bear it,
and as the Band of Hope wanted a banner, I
did a non-alcoholic motto on it in straw
letters, and converted it into a Temperance
banner, and very inspiriting it was. It is the
same with girls. Some you can adapt to all
sorts of purposes, others you can’t.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When Mrs. Saltren had left the room in
quest of her sister-in-law and the baby, Giles
said in a tone of discouragement, “I do not
know what is to be done. It is inevitable
that the news of your being here should reach
Orleigh, either through my mother or the
girl, probably through both, not perhaps at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>once, but eventually. Then—what a difficult
position Lady Lamerton will be in!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell looked down on the carpet, and
traced the pattern with her foot. Presently
she looked up and said, “I see—I never did
justice to the merits of humdrum. Even
when I was shown my folly and acknowledged
my fault, I must needs still play the heroine,
and take a bold step, not altogether justifiable,
because it landed me in falsehood, and involved
others in untruth. But I thought
then it was the simplest course for me to
follow to escape having to equivocate and
even lie. The straight course is always the
best. Now I admit that. Short cuts do not
always lead where one thinks they will. I
wish I had acted with less precipitation and
more modesty, had listened to your advice
and acted without dissimulation. For myself
now I do not care, but I do not see how
my mother and other relations can extricate
themselves from the dilemma in which I have
placed them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nor do I.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am neither dead nor alive. The situation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>is almost grotesque. I wish it were not
distressing. Do not misunderstand me. It
is painful to myself only, as every sharp
lesson cuts. But I am more vexed for the
sake of others than for my own. I have been
a fool, an utter fool.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She put her hands over her eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Upon my word, Mr. Saltren,” she said
after an interval, “I have hardly an atom
of self-confidence left. There never was a
more perverse girl than myself, such a profound
blunderer. I make a mistake whatever
I do. What is to be done? What can
I do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Giles Saltren was silent. The predicament
was one from which there was no
escape.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your mother’s red coverlet was better
than me,” said Arminell. “That did serve
some good purpose, to whatever end it was
turned, but I always get from one difficulty
into another, and drag my friends out of one
discomfort into another still worse. Only
here—here am I of any good at all; I was
born into a wrong sphere, only now have I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>returned to that system in which I ought to
have been planted when called into existence.
And yet even in this I produce a disturbing
effect on the system of planets I have left.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You cannot remain in this house, Miss
Inglett, not now for the reason I gave at
first, but because too much is put upon you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing is put on me—I take on me
what I feel qualified to execute. Do you remember
the answer made by the young
Persian to Cyrus, when the prince reprimanded
him because his actions were not in
accordance with his previously expressed
sentiments? ‘Sire,’ he said, ‘I perceive that
I have two souls in me, one wilful and
wicked, and the other modest and righteous.
Sometimes one is awake and at other times
the second.’ So it is with me. Now I trust
the nobler soul is rubbing its eyes and
stretching itself, and the sandman is scattering
dust in the eyes of the baser soul. My
old soul was haughty and lived in an atmosphere
of extravagance, and the new one is
humble, and delights in the breath of common-place.
Do you remember, Mr. Saltren,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>telling me of the effect of the contrast to you
of a return from Orleigh Park to Chillacot?
You said that you were unfitted by the
grandeur of the former to endure the meanness
of the latter. At the time when you
said this, I thought that such a translation to
me would be unendurable, but the translation
has been effected, and I am not miserable.
On the contrary, but for my self-reproach
and looking back on lost faces and scenes, I
should be happier here; for the childlike
spirit is waking in me, which is content with
trifles.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Happier—here! Miss Inglett, surely
not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—happier. I am happier in helping
others. I am become useful to Mrs. Welsh,
I relieve her of the baby, I can even cook
fairly, I make the glass and silver shine.
The work and worry here were more than
your aunt could bear. Cooks are scarce as
saints. The last your aunt had—oh! I have
already mentioned the circumstances. I will
not repeat them. I do not feel that the
house is small, indeed I am glad that it is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>larger. We talk a good deal about the misdeeds
of servants, and the difficulty there is
in getting cooks; in my former world we
talked a good deal about the unscrupulousness
of politicians, and the difficulty there
was in getting morality among statesmen—political
morality I mean. We discuss now
the humours of the baby, what his dribbling
means—whether teeth or disorder; and we
discussed then the humours of the public, and
what the dribble meant that flowed so freely
at public meetings. We think now how we
may cut out and alter garments for the little
creature; and then, what adjustments and
changes were needed for the satisfaction of
the public. Conversation on each subject is
as interesting and as profitless. I thought at
one time that I could not live away from
rocks and trees—I hardly miss them now. I
have no time to consider whether I want
them or not, because I am engaged all day.
I really believe that the servant girl, the
slavey, as your uncle calls her, is happier
than your aunt or me, because she has the
fewest responsibilities and the most work.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Arminell spoke fast, half in jest, half in
tears; she spoke quickly, to conceal the
emotion she felt.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did you see a picture at the Royal
Academy a few years ago representing the
Babylonian Marriage Market? In old
Babylon all marriageable women were sent
up to auction, and the sum paid for the
pretty ones went as dower for those who
were ugly. Thus was a balance preserved.
I suspect it is much the same in life. There
is equilibrium where we least expect it. The
peacock has a gorgeous plumage and a
horrible voice, the nightingale the sweetest
song and the plainest feathers. Some of our
most radiant flowers are without perfume,
and some that smell odoriferously have little
in the way of beauty to boast of. When I
was in the aristocratic world, I had my
luxuries, intellectual, æsthetic, and physical,
but somehow, I lacked that joyousness I am
finding here. In the middle class there is a
freedom from the restraints which cramped
us in the class above, and I have no doubt
that there is an <i>abandon</i>, an <i>insouciance</i> in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>class below which makes up for the deficiency
in the amenities, refinements, and glow
of life in higher spheres. There is a making
up of the balance, an adjustment of the
equilibrium in the market-place of modern
life as in that of ancient Babylon. Those
with rank and wealth have to walk with
muffled faces, only the plain and lowly may
breathe freely and let the sun kiss their
cheeks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Inglett, I am sure, notwithstanding
your efforts to make me think the contrary,
that you are not happy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I tell you that I am. I say this in all
sincerity. I do not deny that I feel a heartache.
That is because my conscience reproaches
me, and because I now love and
regret what I once cast from me. If I had
not been born elsewhere I should be fresh
and happy now, but every plant suffers for a
while when transplanted. I am throwing
out my rootlets and fastening myself into the
new soil, and will soon be firm fixed in it as
if I had grown there from the beginning—my
only trouble that I have dreams of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>past. A princess was once carried off by
Rübezahl, giant spirit of the mountains, to
his palace of crystal in the heart of the earth.
He gave her all she could wish for, save one
thing, the sound of the cattle bells on the
Alpine pastures. His home was too far
down for those sounds to reach. Whenever
we are carried away from our home, we must
always carry away with us some recollections
of pleasant sounds and sights, and they linger
with us as memories over which to weep.
But there—we have had enough about myself—nay,
too much. I want to hear what
you are about, and what are your prospects.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am in search of occupation, and have,
so far, met only with disappointment.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have been anxious. You are not
looking well.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Naturally, I am anxious. I, like you,
have the weight of the past oppressing me.
Unlike you, I have not accommodated myself
to my transplantation, but—in fact, I have
not yet found soil in which my roots may
take hold.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What soil do you want?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“Any. There is a demand, I am told, for
muscle; the market is glutted with brain, or
what passes for brain. As there is a deficiency
in the supply of cooks, I will mount a
white cap and apron and apply for a kitchen.
But, seriously, apart from my affairs, which
can wait, yours must be attended to.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But nothing can be done. You propose
nothing. I can suggest nothing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then in came Mrs. Welsh and Mrs.
Saltren. The former was carrying the baby.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is all settled,” said Tryphœna Welsh.
“Rejoice with me, Miss Inglett. I did want
a cook, one not given to climbing ladders,
and now I have got one; now James will
swear, for he has been spoiled by your cookery,
Miss Inglett; at last I have got a cook,
the girl Thomasine Kite. Come, kiss the
baby and thank Heaven.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>“Why, blessings on me!” exclaimed Mrs.
Saltren, on her return to the lodgings in
Bloomsbury. “Whoever expected the pleasure!
And—I am sorry that you should see
us here, Captain Tubb; not settled into our
West-End house. Me and my son are looking
about for a suitable residence, genteel and
commodious, and with a W. to the address;
but there is that run on the West End, and it
is almost impossible, without interest, to
get a house. My brother, however, who is
like to be an M.P., is using his influence.
But, captain, you see that every house won’t
suit me; I’m not going to be in the shade
any more. Well, it is a pleasure to see an
Orleigh face here; and, pray, what has
brought you to town, Captain Tubb?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The visitor was in a black suit, that obtained
for his son’s funeral; he held his hat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>in one hand, with a broad black cloth band
about it. With his disengaged hand he
thrust up his beard and nibbled the ends.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ladies play with their fans, coquette with
them, talk with them, angle with them; and
an uninitiated person looking on wonders
what is the meaning of the many movements
made with the fan—the unfurling, the snapping,
the half-opening. Perhaps Captain
Tubb may have been coquetting, talking with
his hat, for he turned it about, then looked
into it, then smoothed it where it was ruffled,
then put it under his chair, then took it up
and balanced it on his knee. I cannot tell.
If he was not speaking with his hat, what else
could he have meant by all the movements
he went through with it?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, ma’am,” said the captain; “seeing
as how I was in London, I thought I’d come
and inquire how you was getting along. How
are you? And how is Mr. Jingles?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I, myself, am but middling,” answered
Mrs. Saltren, with stateliness. “My son—Mr.
Giles Inglett Saltren—is very well indeed.
I have gone through a great deal of trouble,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>and that takes it out of one,” said Mrs. Saltren,
“like spirits of nitre.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So it do, ma’am. There is a vale of
misery; but the sale of Chillacot was an
elevation in the same; and bank-notes are of
that spongy nature that they sop up a lot o’
tears. How, if I may make so bold as to
ask, is your son thinking of investing the
money? You see, ma’am, poor Captain Saltren
and I knowed each other that intimate,
our lines o’ business running alongside of
each other, that we was always a-hailing of
each other. And now that he’s gone, it
seems natural for me to come and consult
with his relict.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re flattering, Mr. Tubb. I must
say, it is a pity my poor Stephen did not
oftener consult me. If he had—but there, I
won’t say what I might. About Chillacot,
he was that pig-headed that—but no, not another
word. I’ve always heard say that the
wife is the better half. What a mercy it is,
and how it proves the wisdom of Providence,
that the wusser half was took away first.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You don’t know, Mrs. Saltren, how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>dreadful you’re missed in Orleigh; the place
don’t seem the same without you. And folks
say such spiteful things too.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As what, captain?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As that, having sold Chillacot, you ought
to spend the purchase money there, and not
be throwing it about in town.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do they now? But I’m not throwing it
about; it is all in the bank.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I reckon Mr. Jingles—I mean your son,
ma’am—has it there in his own name.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not at all, cap’n. The money is mine.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain Tubb whisked round the brim of
his hat with both hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There have been changes since you’ve
gone,” he said. “For one, there is old Sam
Ceely married.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sam Ceely!” echoed Mrs. Saltren, and
dropped her hands in her lap.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It does seem almost wicked for a man at
his time of life and crippled. But he and
Joan Melhuish have been keeping company
a long time, and now he has come in for
some money. I hope,” said the captain,
“that the childer, if there come any, mayn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>come into this world with half their fingers
blowed off through poaching, and a bad life
through drunkenness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Saltren said nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’s another thing,” pursued Captain
Tubb. “The new quarry is running out,
and we’re thinking of reopening the old one.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What—that which is full of water? It
is worked out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, no! there is more lime if more head
be taken off; but there can be nothing done
till the water is pumped out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are thinking of pumping the quarry
dry?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, ma’am; with a water-wheel it could
be cleared. I’ve talked the matter with Mr.
Macduff and the trustees, and they are content
to let me have the quarry rent free for
five years, if I will put up the proper machinery
to get out the water.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The expense will be very heavy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain Tubb stroked his beard, and put
the ends into his mouth; then, after consideration,
he admitted—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, it will cost money.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>“And are you really going to sink money
in pumping out water?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Consider, Mrs. Saltren, that I shall have
the working of the quarry for no rent at all
during five years.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you think it worth the outlay?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Seven per cent. guaranteed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My son says that all I can expect to
get for my capital if invested is five per
cent.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I dare say, in town. At Orleigh, seven.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Neither spoke for some time; Captain
Tubb continued to play alternately with his
beard and his hat; and Mrs. Saltren looked
on the floor, then furtively at her visitor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently the widow asked, “What will
you take? Bottled stout or spirits and
water?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, whichever you drink.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I drink neither,” answered Mrs. Saltren,
drawing herself up. “I taste nothing but
tea and water; but when an old friend comes
and sees me, I make an exception. I have
some whisky in the sideboard—Giles suffers
in his inside, and I’m obliged to keep it by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>me against his attacks. If you will allow
me, I will get it out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She rang for water and tumblers, and produced
the spirits and sugar.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now tell me some further news of Orleigh,”
she said, as she stirred a glass.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There has been the cottage of Patience
Kite done up again,” said he, “and she has
gone back into it, which is unfortunate, for it
would have suited me if I work the old
quarry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But surely it would not be large enough
for you, cap’n?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He shook his head. He had finished his
glass, and now abstractedly he half filled it
with water.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Since poor Arkie died, I’m very lonely.
It is fifteen years since I buried my wife. I
feel as lonely as does this drop o’ water in
the tumbler, without spirits to qualify it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Saltren pushed the whisky bottle
towards him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mix to your liking, captain,” she said.</p>

<p class='c005'>In old English country dances there is a
figure known by the name of l’allemande,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>which consists of a couple dancing round
each other, back to back, after which they
join hands and dance down the middle.
The allemande lingers on in Sir Roger de Coverley,
but is never performed in polite society.
It survives in full force in country courtships.</p>

<p class='c005'>We who live in the midst of artificiality of
all kinds in our time of roses sigh for the unchecked
liberty of the rustic swain and his
milkmaid, and kick at the little etiquettes
which restrain us within the limits of decorum.
But, as a matter of fact, the love-making
below stairs is oblique, prosaic, and of a
back-to-back description, full of restraints
and shynesses, of setting to partners, and
allemanding about them. From the contemplation
of pastoral pictures in red crayon
on our Queen Anne walls, we carry away the
notion that country love-making is direct,
idyllic, and flowery. It is nothing of the
sort. Come, follow the allemanding of this
mature pair.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve not yet been to Brighton and seen
the Aquarium,” said Mrs. Saltren. “Have
you, Captain Tubb?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“Can’t say I have, ma’am. It’s lone work
going by oneself to see fishes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So have I thought,” said the widow.
“And for that reason I’ve not been.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is a wonderful consideration,” said the
captain, “how fond cats are of fish; and
how ill the skin and bones of a salt herring
do make a cat! For myself, I like trout.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, so do I!” said the widow.
“They’re fresher than salt-water fish, as
stands to reason.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The old lord put trout into the quarry-pond,”
said Tubb.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So I’ve heard; and Saltren told me they
were monstrous fat and large.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is no catching them,” observed
the captain; “the water is clear, and they
are wary. If ever I pump the pond dry,
ma’am, you shall have a dish.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Trout should be eaten when they are
just out of the water,” said Mrs. Saltren;
“they lose their flavour when a day old. I
suppose it will not be possible for me to have
them trout you so kindly offer the same day
they are ketched.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>“Not possible if you are in London,”
answered the captain. “Perhaps you’d best
come to Orleigh to eat ’em.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then ensued a silence, broken at last by
Mrs. Saltren, who remarked, with a sigh—</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’ll be no eating of them trout till
the pump is got.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is true,” sighed Tubb. “But then
the money is sure to be raised wherewith to
put up the water-wheel and pump. Just
consider, ma’am, seven per cent. You’ve
not thought of investing, have you, what you
got by the sale of Chillacot?”</p>

<p class='c005'>This was a direct question, and the captain
was scared at his temerity in putting it. He
ate a whole mouthful of his beard.</p>

<p class='c005'>“‘A fool and her money are soon parted,’
says the proverb,” answered Mrs. Saltren.
“Consequently, I don’t think I’ll let my
money go anywhere without me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain Tubb drew his chair closer; and,
instead of settling the matter at once, began
a fresh allemand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you think of mutton here in
London?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“I don’t relish it; and it is awfully dear,
so is beef. Elevenpence and a shilling for
what at Orleigh cost eightpence and ninepence.
What fortunes them butchers must be
making!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It seems a sin to encourage them,” said
Tubb.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It does go against my conscience,” agreed
Mrs. Saltren.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then,” argued the captain, “I wouldn’t
encourage them. Twopence and threepence
in the pound is too much.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ve a mind to return to the country,”
said Mrs. Saltren; “I don’t want to encourage
such wickedness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And then, ma’am, you can eat the trout
fresh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah, captain! but the capital for pumping?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Captain Tubb cautiously slid
one arm round Mrs. Saltren’s waist, and
said—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, Marianne, with your capital, away
from the mutton of town to the trout of the
country.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“I should like ’em fresh,” said the widow.
“We’ll pump together for them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The youthful romance-reader exacts of a
novel some love-making, and, to satisfy this
reader, I have given this pathetic and
romantic scene in full. To this sort of
reader, style is nothing, characterisation is
nothing, the grammar is nothing—indeed the
whole story is nothing if there be in it no
love-making.</p>

<p class='c005'>That is the spice which flavours the dish,
and without it the dish is rejected as unpalatable.</p>

<p class='c005'>To encourage this reader, accordingly, at
the outset a chapter was devoted to love-making
in tandem, and another to love-making
abreast. Only one of those love-affairs
has come to a happy conclusion; one
was broken off by the breaking-down of
Patience Kite’s chimney. To make up to
the reader for her disappointment, I have inserted
this other love scene, and have
introduced it near the end of my book to
stimulate the jaded appetite to finish it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Is it false to nature? Only those will say
so who are ignorant of country courtships.
Oh, for a Dionysian ear through which to listen
to—not the sighs of prisoners, but the coo of
turtle-doves! Now it so fell out that the
writer of these lines was himself, on one
occasion, an eye-and-ear witness to the wooing
of a rustic couple—involuntarily. It
came about in this way.</p>

<p class='c005'>When I was a boy, on a Sunday, I had set
a trap to catch rats that scared the scullery-maid
in the back kitchen, and caused her to
drop my mother’s best china. But as rat-catching
was not considered by my parents a
Sabbatical amusement, I set my traps on the
sly when they were at church on Sunday
afternoon, and I was at home with a cold.
The house-maid was left in charge, and
naturally admitted her lover to assist her in
watching after the safety of the house. Both
seated themselves in the kitchen, one in the
settle, the other in a chair before the fire.
When I, in the back kitchen, heard them
enter, I was afraid to stir lest my parents
should be informed of my proceedings, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>the sanctity of the Sabbath be impressed
tinglingly on me, across my father’s knee,
with the back of a hair-brush, a paper-knife,
or a slipper. Accordingly I kept
still.</p>

<p class='c005'>Twenty minutes had elapsed, and no words
having passed I stole to the kitchen door and
peeped through. The maid sat on the settle,
the swain on the chair, unctuously ogling
each other in silence.</p>

<p class='c005'>After the lapse of twenty minutes by the
clock, the youth lifted up his voice and said
solemnly, “Mary, what be that there thing
for?” and he pointed to a button above the
kitchen range.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That, Joshua, is the damper.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again silence fell over the kitchen, only
broken by the ticking of the clock. After the
expiration of twenty minutes more, the youth
further inquired, “And what be the damper
for, Mary?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“For to make the fire go a smother-like,
Joshua,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again twenty minutes elapsed: then I
heard a long-drawn sigh, and Joshua said in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>a grave, emotionless voice, “Mary, there be
no damper in my buzzom.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There come master and mistress from
church,” exclaimed Mary; “Joshua, you
must go.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lord!” said the swain, slowly rising,
“how I have enjoyed myself, Mary.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Next Sunday the banns were called.</p>

<p class='c005'>This was slow allemanding indeed, quite
at the cinque-pace, but then it was the love-making
of an inexperienced youthful couple.
Marianne Saltren and Captain Tubb had
gone through the process at least once
previously, so that there was not the same
shyness and stiffness in their courtship.
Nevertheless they conformed to the rule of
country courtship, and allemanded about each
other, though, I grant you, at a sprightlier
pace than that of Joshua and Mary, before
they joined hands and went down the middle.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XLIX.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>TWO ORLEIGH GIRLS.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Welsh burst in on Arminell one evening
just before dinner with a face of dismay,
and both her hands uplifted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mercy on us! What do you think?”
Arminell stood up. “What has happened,
Mrs. Welsh?” she asked in some alarm.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear! You might have knocked me
down with a feather. I thought that the
girl would be sure to know how to do boiled
rabbit with onion sauce.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Does she not?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And there was to be a Swiss pudding.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That, probably, she would not know how
to make, but she can read, and has Mrs.
Warne to fly to for light.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I put out the currant jelly for the
pudding, and she has spread it over the
rabbit on top of the onion sauce.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell was unable to restrain a laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“I went down to see her dish up, and that
is what she has done. Poured the onion
sauce over the rabbit and heaped the currant
jelly a top of that. Whatever shall we do?
The last cook was bad enough, but she did
not spoil good food.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What induced her to do this?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She says that she has been told to put
currant jelly with hare, and so she has put it
with rabbit, as she saw the jelly-pot set out
on the kitchen table for the pudding.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And the pudding?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is without anything. We cannot eat the
rabbit. That is spoiled; and the pudding is
nothing without red currant jelly. Whatever
will Mr. Welsh do for his dinner?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But the girl had Mrs. Warne’s Cookery
Book on the table for reference?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, but she also had a sensational novel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell laughed again. “I am afraid
the education she has received has garnished
her head much in the same fashion as she has
garnished the rabbit, several good things
jumbled together, making an unpalatable
whole. I will go and see what can be done.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“I have given the girl notice.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Surely not, Mrs. Welsh. She has but
just come to town.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I spoke sharply to her, and girls now-a-days
will not bear a word. She flew out at
me and said she would not remain another
hour in the house. Girls give themselves
such airs. She knows my extremity, how
long I have been without a cook.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell descended to the kitchen, but
Thomasine was not there. The boiled
rabbit stood on the table crowned with
onion sauce and crimson jelly. Near it lay,
wide open, a book, not so thick as Mrs.
Warne’s Cookery Manual, and Arminell
stooped to look at it. The book was Gaboriau’s
“Gilded Clique,” much stained and
cockled, as if it had been wet through, and
then dried. Arminell turned it over; it was
her own copy, which she had flung from her
when in the Owl’s Nest, to arouse and arrest
the attention of Captain Saltren. She could
not doubt that it was the identical book, for
her name was pencilled on it, and the water
had not effaced the pencil scrawl. She did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>not know, what was the fact, that the book
had undergone two immersions, and had
twice been recovered by Patience, and that
on the last occasion she had passed it on to
her daughter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell stood turning over the disfigured
volume, speculating on how it had come into
Thomasine’s hands, and thinking of the
occasion when she had last read it; and so
thinking, for a moment she forgot the rabbit
with its incongruous garnishment, and why
she had descended to the kitchen. She was
roused from her reverie by the maid-of-all-work
coming in excitedly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh my, miss! What do you think?
Thomasine has flown out at missus, and
packed up her things in a bundle, and gone.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thomasine gone!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lawk, miss! She wouldn’t stand no
nonsense, she said; and if the missus didn’t
like her cooking she might cook for herself.
She wouldn’t stay. Thomasine had a flaming
temper; it’s the way of them red-headed
girls.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thomasine gone!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>“Gone in a tantrum, her cheeks as red as
her head. I can’t think what folks find to
admire in her hair. It is thick and red. I
don’t fancy carrots.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But whither is she gone? She is a
stranger in London, and has no friends.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t suppose, miss, she knows herself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Has she gone back to Mrs. Saltren?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t fancy so. She was in such a
rage, she thought of nothing but going, and
never even asked for her wage.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you know in which direction she
went?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I was not on the look-out. She
came flaring on me to give me good-bye,
and away she went. She said that as the
missus had insulted her, go she would to
where she would be valued.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you no idea where she is gone?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know.” The girl hesitated, then
said, “Thomasine said as how there was a
gentleman at the hotel where Mrs. Saltren
first was, who admired her and said she
ought never to demean herself to go into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>service—I can’t say, she has spoken of him
once or twice, and I fancy he came to look
for her when she was at the lodgings with
Mrs. Saltren—she may have gone to ask his
advice what to do and where to go.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is enough,” said Arminell, and ran
upstairs, put on her bonnet, and hastened
into the street. She was doubtful in which
direction to turn, but seeing the postman
coming with the letters, she asked him if he
had observed a girl with red hair.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What, the new cook at Mrs. Welsh’s,
miss? Oh, yes, she has gone by with a
bundle. Very ’ansome girl, that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell went down the Avenue, and at
the corner encountered a policeman on duty.
She asked him the same question. He also
had noticed Thomasine. Indeed he knew
her. Her splendid build, her profusion of
glowing hair, and beautiful complexion were
a phenomenon in Shepherd’s Bush, and all
milkmen, butchers’ boys, postmen, police,
knew and admired her, though she had been
in the house of Mrs. Welsh but a fortnight.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, miss, she’s gone down that way—has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>a bundle in her hand. I asked her
whither she was going and she said she was
leaving her situation because her mistress
was impudent to her. Wery ’ansome gall,
that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell went on to a cabstand; she was
near the Hammersmith Station. As a disengaged
flyman hailed her, she asked him if he
had seen a young woman go by carrying a
bundle.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A ’ansome gal with red hair? To be
sure. ’Ailed her, but she said she’d take a
’bus.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Take a ’bus!—she had gone on to that
great centre of radiating streets and roads a
few steps ahead. Arminell quickened her
pace, almost ran, and reached the main artery
of traffic between the City and Hammersmith
through Kensington. She had a sharp eye,
and in a moment saw Thomasine, who was
mounting an omnibus. She ran, as the
horses started—ran, regardless of what any
one might think, but could not overtake the
’bus. She signed to the driver of a passing
empty cab.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“Keep up with the Hammersmith omnibus,”
she said, panting. “When it stops,
set me down. Here is a shilling.” She
sprang in, and speedily caught up the scarlet-bodied
conveyance, descended from the cab,
entered the omnibus, and seated herself
beside Thomasine.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was out of breath, the perspiration ran
off her brow, and her heart beat fast. She
could not speak, but she laid her hand on that
of the girl which rested on the bundle, and
the action said, “I have taken you in charge.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She was beside Thomasine, and could not
see her face; she did not attempt to look at
her, but kept her hand where she had laid it,
till the omnibus halted at Broad Walk in
front of Kensington Palace; by this time she
had recovered her breath sufficiently to bid
the conductor let her out. She rose hastily,
still holding Thomasine, who did not
stir.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come,” said Arminell, “come with me,”
and looked the girl straight in the eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thomasine’s hand quivered under that of
Arminell, and her face flushed. She dropped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>her eyes and rose. In another moment they
were together on the pavement.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We will walk together,” said Miss Inglett,
“up the broad avenue. I want to speak to
you. I want to know why you are running
away, and whither you are going?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please, miss,” answered the girl, “I ain’t
going to be spoken to by Mrs. Welsh. Her’s
nothing, nor old Welsh neither. He is the
brother of Marianne Saltren, and no better
than me or my mother. They may set up to
be gentlefolk and give themselves airs, but
they are only common people like myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have made a mistake, Thomasine.
You should not have put the currant jelly
over the boiled rabbit. Those who make
mistakes must have them corrected. How
would you like to have your pretty velvet
bonnet spoiled by Mrs. Welsh spilling ink
over it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should be angry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, it is the same case. You have
spoiled the nice dinner she had provided for
Mr. Welsh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Welsh is nothing. His father was an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>old Methody shopkeeper, who ran away,
having cheated a lot of folk out of their
money. I know all about the Welshes. I’m
not going to stand cheek from them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you will listen to a word from me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, miss, you are different. I wouldn’t
be impudent to you for anything. But it is
other with them stuck-ups as are no better
than myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will not try to twist yourself away
from me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, miss.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I want you to tell me, Thomasine,
whither you were running? Were you
going to Mrs. Saltren?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mrs. Saltren!” scoffed the girl. “She
is nothing. Marianne Saltren, the daughter
of the canting old cheat, and widow of a
mining captain. I won’t be servant to her.
Not I.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Whither were you going, then?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thomasine was silent.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell walked at her side; she had let
go the girl’s hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ran after you,” said Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“Was that what made you so hot and out
of breath, miss?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I was frightened when I heard that
you had gone away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What was there to frighten you? I had
not taken any spoons.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I never supposed that for a moment. I
was alarmed about yourself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can take care of myself. I am old
enough.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not sure that you can take care of
yourself, Thomasine; you and I come from
the same place, dear Orleigh, and it is such
a pleasure to me to see you, and hear you
talk. When I found that you were gone, I
thought what shall I do without my dear
Tamsine to talk with about the old place I
love so much?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why don’t you go back to it, miss, if you
like it?” asked the girl.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because I cannot. Come closer to me.”
Arminell caught the girl’s hand again. “I
also ran away. I ran away, as you are running
away now. That has brought upon me
great sorrow and bitter self-reproach, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>would save you from doing the same thing
that I have done, and from the repentance
that comes too late.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They said at Orleigh, miss, that you
were dead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am dead to Orleigh and all I love
there. Why did you come to town with
Mrs. Saltren, if you do not care to be with
her?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because I wanted to see the world, but I
had no intention of remaining with her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then what did you intend?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thomasine shrugged her shoulders. “I
wanted to see life, and have some fun, and
know what London was like. I don’t want
to slave here as I slaved in a farm.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You came to town restless and discontented,
so did I; and now I would give
everything I have to be set back where I
was. You came in the same spirit, and I
have stopped you on the threshold of a grave
disaster, and perhaps saved you from unutterable
misery. Thomasine, dear Thomasine,
tell me the truth. Were you going to that
hotel where some one flattered your vanity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>and held out to you prospects of idleness?
You were leaving hard work and the duties
that fell to your lot where God placed you,
because impatient of restraint. You had
learned the one lesson that is taught in all
schools to boys and girls alike—hatred of
honest work. Tamsine, you must return
with me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The girl pouted. Arminell, looking round,
saw the curl in her lip.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t care to be under the Welshes,”
said the girl; “nor Marianne Saltren,
neither. They ain’t better than me, and
why shouldn’t I be as stylish as they?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you resent being with them, be with
me. Be my maid. I am not going to
remain in Shepherd’s Bush. I intend to
take a house somewhere in the country—somewhere
where I can be useful, and,
Tamsine, find work, hard work that I can do
for others. That is what I seek now for myself.
Will you come with me? Then we
two Orleigh girls will be together, that will
be charming.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thomasine turned and looked wonderingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>at Miss Inglett. We two Orleigh girls!
We—the baron’s daughter and the wise
woman’s bastard.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’d like my frolic first,” said Thomasine.</p>

<p class='c005'>“After that—I could not receive you,”
answered Arminell gravely.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t see,” said Thomasine, still pouting,
but uneasy and undecided, with the
colour flying in flakes over her face and showing
through the transparent complexion.
“I don’t see why we are to be always kept
at work, and not be allowed to amuse ourselves.
We aren’t young for long.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tamsine,” said Arminell, “poor Arkie
Tubb sat by you when your mother’s cottage
was being pulled down, and when you
thought that she was in danger, and you
could not run to her aid yourself, because
you had turned your ankle, you sent him.
You sent him to his death. The chimney
fell and buried him. If he had considered
himself he would not have risked his life
for your mother. We all honour him for
what he did. He never was clever and
sharp in life, he failed in everything he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>undertook, he even failed then, for he did not
bring your mother out of the ruin, he was
buried in it himself. But he was a hero in
his death because he sacrificed himself for
others—for you, because he loved you, and
for your mother.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thomasine said nothing, but her hand
twitched in that of Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You must be worthy of him, remain
worthy of him. Thomasine, if you follow
your own self-will and passion for pleasure,
people will say it was well that Arkie Tubb
died, she was not deserving of him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They had reached the head of the Broad
Walk, and issued from Kensington Park into
Uxbridge Road. The stream of traffic
flowed east and west, east to the City, west
to Shepherd’s Bush, past them, and they
stood watching the two currents. Thomasine
withdrew her hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell was certain that this was a critical
moment in the girl’s heart. She said nothing
more. She had said enough, she waited.
Thomasine turned her face east, and took a
step in that direction with a red flush in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>cheek. Then the red flush rose to her brow
and deserted her cheek, and she turned back.</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently she said, “May I take your
hand again, miss?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell readily gave it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Thomasine strode to the west, holding
Arminell. She seemed fearful of herself
if left to herself, but confident whilst holding
the hand of Arminell. The good angel had
conquered, and that good angel was the
thought of poor, blundering, kindly, stupid
Arkie Tubb.</p>

<p class='c005'>Is ever a life utterly thrown away? It had
seemed so when the stones crushed the soul
out of that lad. A profitless life had ended
unprofitably. But see! Here at the end of
Broad Walk, Kensington, that cast-away life
was the saving of the girl whom he had loved
unprofitably.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER L.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>A RAZOR TO CUT CABBAGES.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>An old man told me one day that he had
spent fifty years of his life in making a concordance
of the Bible—he had never heard of
Cruden’s work. The labour of fifty years
thrown away! I know another who sank all
his savings in publishing a Law Compendium
he had compiled, and when it was published
sold two copies.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jingles was going through a heart-breaking
experience. He was discovering that all he
had acquired in school and university was a
disadvantage to him in the position in which
he now found himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had been well educated, had been
polished and sharpened; but the money
spent on his education might as well have
been thrown into the sea, and the time
devoted to learning have been as profitably
given up to billiards.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>This would not have been the case had
Giles Inglett Saltren been able to enter a
learned profession, but as this was out of the
question, his education was profitless. He
had been qualified to take his place in a social
class in which he was no more able to show
himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day Jingles had given his razor to a
boy to sharpen for him. The lad took it to
a grindstone and put an edge to the back.
“Please, sir,” said the fellow when reprimanded,
“the front was middling sharp, so I
thought I’d put an edge to the back.”
Jingles remembered this incident now with
some bitterness. He had been sharpened on
the wrong side for cutting his way. He was
a classic scholar, knew his Æschylus and
Euripides, and could write elegant Latin
verses. He was disciplined in the manners
and habits of the upper class. But he knew
little of modern languages, and his working
out a sum in compound addition left much to
be desired.</p>

<p class='c005'>At first he looked out for such a situation
as would suit him, but speedily discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>that what he must find was a situation which
he would suit.</p>

<p class='c005'>A librarianship, a secretaryship, lastly a
tutorship, commended themselves to him as
situations for which he was qualified; but
such situations are few, and the applicants
are legion.</p>

<p class='c005'>The paralytic in the Gospel was always
wanting to be let down into Siloam after the
troubling of the water, but invariably found
that some one else had stepped in whilst he
was being carried, or was laboriously
dragging himself to the brink. It was so
with Jingles. When he did hear of a vacancy
that would suit him, and made application
for it, it was to find that another had stepped
in before him.</p>

<p class='c005'>He tried for private pupils. He was
ready to attend any house and teach during
the day. He would prefer that to being
again taken into a family as a resident
tutor, but he was not even as successful as
Nicholas Nickleby. There were no little
Miss Kenwigses to be taught.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had a difficulty about giving references.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>He could not mention Lady Lamerton, and
invite inquiries concerning him of the family
at Orleigh Park. At first he was reluctant
to apply to his uncle for a testimonial, or for
leave to use his name, but when he found
that his way was blocked through lack of
references, he swallowed his pride and asked
the requisite permission of Mr. Welsh. The
leave was granted and conduced to nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>If pride could have fattened, about this
time Jingles ought to have grown plump, he
swallowed so much of it; but it was like
blackbeetles to a cat—it made him grow
lanker.</p>

<p class='c005'>He spent a good deal of money in advertising
in the daily papers, but got no answers.
Then he took to answering advertisements,
and met with no better success. Then he
applied to agents, paid fees, and got no
further. It was to the advantage of these
go-betweens to put bad men in good posts,
and thrust good men into bad posts, to plant
square men into round holes, and round men
in square holes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every change brought an additional fee,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>and naturally this consideration had its influence
on the agents.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a whole class of middle schools
conducted by speculative men without education
themselves, for the sons of tradesmen
and farmers, where the teaching given was of
the worst description, and the moral supervision
was of the most inefficient quality.
The ushers in these were Germans, Swiss,
and French, men out of pocket and out at
elbows, picking up a wretched subsistence,
and eating as their daily diet humble pie.
The doors of these “Academies for Young
Gentlemen” were closed to Saltren because
he was an University man and a scholar.
He was dangerous, he knew too much,
and might expose the hollowness of these
swindles.</p>

<p class='c005'>Convinced at length that there was no
hope of his getting any place such as he
would like, in which his acquirements would
avail, Jingles turned to commercial life. But
here also he found that his education stood
in the way. He went to Mincing Lane in
quest of a clerkship in one of the great tea,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>rice, sugar, and spice firms; but there an
accountant and not a logician was wanted.</p>

<p class='c005'>Next he visited Mark Lane and sought
admission into one of the great corn-factors’
offices. He was too raw for these men;
what were wanted in such houses as these in
Mark and Mincing Lanes were sharp lads of
from seventeen to nineteen, trained at Board
Schools, who could reckon rapidly, and were
not above being sent messages; lads who
would be filed into business shape, who were
disciplinable to take a special line, not young
men educated already and with their heads
stuffed with matter utterly useless for business.</p>

<p class='c005'>In a state of discouragement Jingles next
visited Lloyds. There it was the same.
What did he want? To become an underwriter!
Well and good, let him deposit five
thousand pounds and find a clerk at two
hundred, with five per cent, on all transactions,
till he had himself thoroughly mastered the
system of underwriting. He could not afford
this. He must be taken on as clerk.
Where? At Lloyds, or at one of the Marine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Insurance offices that has its base at Lloyds.
What did he know of the work? The clerk
has to go round with policies to be initialed,
and when the books return to the office after
four o’clock, he has to make them up. What
did he understand about the value of cargoes
and the risks run? There was no place for
him in a Marine Insurance. Some one recommended
him to try stockbroking.</p>

<p class='c005'>Like a greenhorn, as he was, Jingles made
at once for the Exchange, and passing the
porters, entered the House. The vast space
was crowded. The din bewildered him.
He heard names shouted from the telegraph
offices, the call of porters, the voices of the
stock-jobbers raised in dispute or argument.
All at once an exclamation, “Seventeen hundred.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
Then ensued a gravitation towards
himself, and in a moment his hat was knocked
over his eyes, then he was thrust, elbowed,
jostled from side to side.</p>

<p class='c005'>When he recovered his sight, his hat was
snatched from his hand and flung across the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>House. Next, his umbrella was wrenched
from him, and with it he was struck over the
back.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have no right in here, sir,” said a
porter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t mind him,” shouted a dozen
around. “We are heartily glad to make
your acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The horseplay was resumed, and as the
young man’s blood rose, and he resented the
treatment, and showed fight, he was still
more roughly handled, and finally found himself
kicked and hustled out of the Exchange.</p>

<p class='c005'>Giles Saltren stood on the step without,
minus a hat and umbrella, and with his coat
split down the back—his best coat put on to
produce a good impression on employers—stood
dazed and humbled, an object of derision
to match-boys and flower-girls who
danced about him, with words and antics of
mockery.</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently an old white-haired stockbroker,
who came out of the Exchange, noticed him,
and stopped and spoke to him, and bade him
not be angry. What had occurred was due
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>to his having intruded where he had no right
to be. Jingles answered that he had gone
there because he was in quest of employment,
whereupon he was told he might just
as well have jumped into the Thames because
he desired engagement on a penny
steamer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Young gentleman,” said the broker, “it
is of no use your looking for employment in
our line of business. We have a Clerks’
Provident Fund, to which every clerk out of
employ subscribes; and if a broker wants a
man at forty, sixty, a hundred, two hundred
pounds, he applies to the secretary of the
Provident Fund, who furnishes him with the
man he wants out of the number of those
then disengaged. You have no experience,
or you would not have ventured into the
House. If I want an errand boy, I take on
the son of a clerk. You have, I fear, no
connexions in the line to speak a word for
you! You have been to the University, do
you say?”</p>

<p class='c005'>The broker whistled.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My good sir, I do not recommend you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>to waste time in applying at stockbrokers’
offices; you are likely to make acquaintance
with the outside only of their office doors.
There is more chance for the son of a bed-maker
or a chimney-sweep than for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Giles Saltren next sought admission into a
bank, but found that this was a business even
more close than that of stock-jobbing. The
banking business was like the sleeping Brynhild,
surrounded by a <i>waberlohe</i>, a wall of
flame; and he was no Siegfried to spur his
horse through the ring of fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>Having discovered how futile were his attempts
to enter a bank, he turned to the
docks, in hopes of getting a situation in a
shipping-office, only there also to meet with
rebuff.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he saw an advertisement from a
West-End shop-keeper, one of those giants
of trade, who has an universal store. There
was a vacancy in the stocking department for
a young man. Applicants were to appear
personally at a fixed hour on Friday next.</p>

<p class='c005'>Giles Inglett hesitated before he could resolve
to offer himself as a counter-jumper,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>and acquire the “What can we serve you
next with, ma’am?” To descend to the
counter from the Oxford schools was a great
descent; but Jingles was like a vessel in
stress of weather, throwing overboard all her
lading. Away must go his Greek, his Latin,
his logic, his position as an University
scholar, that of a gentleman, his self-esteem,
certainly, his self-respect to some extent, his
ambition altogether.</p>

<p class='c005'>But why not? He was not born to be a
gentleman; it was by a happy accident that
he had been given an education that furnished
him with most accomplishments which
adorn a man of birth and standing. He
must remember that he was not entitled by
his parentage to anything above a shopman’s
place, and must gulp down this junk of pride.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the appointed day Saltren went to
Westbourne Grove, and found that he was
but one of between three or four hundred
young men, applicants for the vacancy behind
the stocking counter. His appearance,
delicate and refined, the diffidence with which
he spoke, were against him, and he found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>himself at once and decisively rejected, and a
vulgar young fellow at his side, full of self-conceit,
was chosen instead.</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren made application in other offices,
but always without success: his ignorance of
shorthand was against him. In the offices of
solicitors it is indispensable that shorthand be
practised by the clerks. It facilitates and
expedites the dictation of letters.</p>

<p class='c005'>So also, had he been a proficient in shorthand,
he might have obtained work as a
reporter at meetings. But to his grief he
discovered that all the education he had received
which tended to broaden the mind
was valueless, that only was profitable which
contracted the intellect. Saltren, moreover,
was speedily given to understand that unless
he went in search of a situation with gold in
his hand, he could get nothing. With
capital, his intellectual culture would be
graciously overlooked and excused. His
university education was such a drawback,
that it could only be forgiven if he put money
into the concern where he proposed to enter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren had come to the end of his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>resources, and he saw that without capital he
could get admission nowhere. He could not
obtain a clerkship in any kind of business;
the sole chance of entering a commercial life
was to become a partner in one.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was abundance of advertisements
for partners in the daily papers, but nearly all
the businesses, when examined, proved unsatisfactory,
and the risk of losing all too
great. Giles Saltren had, indeed, no capital
of his own; but he resolved, should he see a
chance of making an investment that was
safe, and one which would give him work in
a partnership, to propose to his mother that
she should in this manner dispose of the
purchase-money for Chillacot. She would
derive from it an annual sum as interest, and
have the satisfaction as well of knowing that
she had found employment for her son.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last he found what he sought, and
sanguine as to the results, he came to his
mother’s lodgings to make the proposal to her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please, Mr. Saltren,” said the landlady;
“your mother has gone out with the admiral.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The admiral?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“Ah, the admiral, sir!” said the landlady,
with a knowing smile. “You don’t mean to
say, Mr. Saltren, that your mother hasn’t
told you? and a beautiful breakfast spread, and
a cake with a cupid at top all made of sugar.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But what admiral? We know no admiral!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What, not Admiral Tubb? Well, now,
Mr. Saltren, who would have thought your
mother would have been so sly as not to
have told you that she was going to give you
a new pa?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Upon my word, I do not understand you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then, Mr. Saltren, you come along with
me, and see the breakfast laid in the dining-room,
and the beautiful wedding-cake all over
orange-flowers. It does seem sharp work
too, when your father died so very recently;
but if widows don’t seize the moments as
they fly, and take admirals by the forelock,
they may be left in their weeds till it is too
late. Why, bless me, Mr. Saltren, here they
come!</p>

<p class='c005'>“But,” persisted Jingles, much astonished,
and almost persuaded that Mrs. Bankes, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>lodging-house-keeper, had gone off her head,
“what admiral?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Admiral Tubb, sir, R.N. Your mother
told me so. There they are. Lawk, sir! he
in lavender don’t-mention-ems and yaller
gloves; and she in a beautiful Brussels veil
that must have cost ten pounds, and the
cabby wearing of a favour.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Into the house sailed Mrs. Saltren—Saltren
no more, but Tubb—with a long white veil
over her head, and orange-blossoms in her
hand, wearing a grey silk gown. Captain
Tubb advanced with her on his arm, and
looked red and sheepish.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My child,” said Marianne, “come and
salute your new father. This distinguished
officer—I mean,” she hesitated and corrected
herself, “Bartholomew Tubb has prevailed
on me to lay aside my widow’s cap for the
bridal-veil. And, oh! my Giles, you will be
pleased to hear that the capital I got through
the sale of Chillacot is to be sunk in the old
quarry, and me and the admiral—I mean
Tubb—are going to join hands and pump
the water out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>About the same time that Jingles was
situation-hunting, Arminell was engaged in
house-hunting. She had made up her mind
to take a cottage on the south coast. Mrs.
Welsh had, at length, got a cook who did
passably. She had fits occasionally and
frothed at the mouth; she also kicked out
with her legs convulsively on these occasions
and kicked over every little table near her,
regardless of what was on it—a glass custard-dish,
a sugar-bowl, or, indeed, anything
smashable. However, between her fits she
was a good plain cook, and the fits did not
come on every day. When they did, Mrs.
Welsh telegraphed to her husband to dine at
a restaurant, and she satisfied herself on
scraps. Consequently, the inconvenience
was not serious, and as cooks are rare as
capercailzies, Mrs. Welsh was glad to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>one even with the disadvantage of epileptic
attacks.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Welsh placed himself and his time at
the service of Arminell. He went with her
to Brighton, St. Leonards, Worthing, Littlehampton,
Bournemouth; and finally Arminell
decided on purchasing a small house at the
last-named place—a pretty villa among the
pines, with a view of the sea, a garden, a
conservatory. The girl had scruples about
troubling the journalist so much, but he
insisted that his excursions with her gave
him pleasure, and he did everything he could
for her, and did it in the most cheery, considerate
and hearty manner.</p>

<p class='c005'>Welsh was a shrewd man of business, and
he fought hard over the terms before he
bought, and keenly scrutinised the title.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then ensued the furnishing, and in this
Arminell did not trust Mr. Welsh. His ambition
was to do all his purchases cheaply. He
would have ordered her sets for her several
rooms in Tottenham Court Road, and gloried
in having got them at an extraordinarily low
figure. Arminell took Mrs. Welsh with her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>when making her purchases; not that she
placed any value on that lady’s taste, but because
she was well aware that by so doing
she was giving to her hostess the richest treat
she could devise. There is, undoubtedly,
positive enjoyment in spending money, and
next to the pleasure of spending money oneself,
is that of accompanying another shopping
who spends money. After a day’s
shopping and the expenditure of a good
many pounds, unquestionably one feels morally
elevated. And one is conscious of having
done meritoriously when one acts as a
goad to a companion, urging her to more
lavish outlay, spurring her on when her heart
fails at the estimation of the cost. How
mean you think your friend if she buys
material at twopence-three-farthings instead
of that which is superior at threepence.
How vehemently you impress on her the
mistake of purchasing only five-and-a-half
yards instead of six. Margin, you urge,
should always be given. It is false economy
to cut your cloth too close. With what
rigidity of spinal marrow do you sit on your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>tall chair and scorn the woman on your left
who asks for cheaper Swiss embroidery at
threepence-farthing, when your friend on
your right is buying hers at a shilling. With
what an approving glow of conscience do
you smile when you hear your companion’s
bill reckoned up as over fifteen pounds; and
then you snatch the opportunity to secure a
remnant or a piece of tarnished material,
with a haughty air, and bid that it be put in
with the rest—it will serve for a charity in
which you are interested: to wit—but you
do not add this—the charity that begins and
ends with home.</p>

<p class='c005'>Next to the enjoyment of shopping with a
friend, who is lavish of her money, comes the
luxury of discussing the purchases after, of
debating whether this stamped velvet was,
after all, the right thing, and whether that
tapestry silk would not have been better;
whether the carpet and the curtains will harmonise,
and the paper of the wall accord with
both.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a disappointment to Mrs. Welsh
that Arminell did not have a dado with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>water-reeds and sunflowers, and storks flying
or standing on one leg. “It is the fashion,
I assure you,” said she, “as you may see in
our drawing-room at Shepherd’s Bush.” But
then, it was a shock of surprise and adoring
admiration that came on Tryphœna Welsh,
when, after having advised jute for curtains
and sofa-covers, because so extraordinarily
cheap, Arminell had deliberately turned to
stamped velvet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear me!” said Mrs. Welsh to her husband
one night, when they were alone, “how
you do worship Miss Inglett. Not that I’m
jealous. Far be it from me, for I admire her
as much as I love her; but I’m surprised at
it in you—and she related to the nobility. It
is inconsistent, Welsh, with your professions,
as inconsistent as it would be for Mr. Spurgeon
to be found crossing himself in a Roman
Catholic chapel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear Tryphœna,” said James Welsh,
“I do not deny that the British aristocracy
has its good qualities—for one, its want of
stuck-upedness. For another, its readiness
to adapt itself to circumstances. It is part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>of their education, and it is not part of ours,
and I don’t pretend to that which I have not
got. They used to make wooden dolls with
a peg through their joints, so that they would
move their limbs forward and backward, and
that was all. Now there is another contrivance
introduced, the ball and socket system
for the joints, and dolls can now move their
legs and arms in all directions, describe circles
with them, do more with them than I can
with mine. It is the same with the faculties
of the aristocracy, there is a flexibility and a
pliability in them that shows they are on the
ball and socket system, and not upon the peg
arrangement. I don’t mean to say that there
are not to be found elsewhere faculties so
variable and adaptable, but it is exceptional
elsewhere; among the upper classes the
whole educational system is directed towards
making the mental joints revolve in their
sockets, and getting rid of all woodenness and
pegishness. Look at Miss Inglett. She was
ready to be just what you wanted—cook, nurse,
butler, seamstress—and yet never for a second
has ceased to be what she is, a tip-top lady.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>“You talk, James, in a different way from
what you used to talk.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll tell you what stands in the way with
us. Even if we be gifted with faculties on
the ball and socket system, we are afraid of
using them except as is allowed by fashion,
and is supposed to be elegant. We are ever
considering whether we shall not lose respect
if we employ them in this way, set them at
that angle, fold them in such a manner, turn
them about in such another. I know once,”
continued Mr. Welsh, “I had burst my boot
over the toe, just before I went for an important
interview with an editor. I cut a
sorry figure in his presence, because I was
considering the hole in my boot, and whether
my stocking showed through. I put my foot
under the chair as far back as I could, then
drew it forward and set the other foot on it.
Then I hid it behind my hat, then curled it
over in an ungainly fashion, so as to expose
only the sole; and all the while I was with
the editor, I had no thought for what we
were talking about; I could not take my
attention from the hole in my boot. And it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>is the same with us who haven’t an all-round
and complete culture—we are conscious of
burst seams, and splits, and exposures, and
are anxious to be screening them, and so are
never at our ease.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When Mr. Welsh began to talk, he liked
to talk on uninterruptedly. His wife knew
this, and humoured him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Connected with this subject, Tryphœna,
is the way in which the aristocracy manage
their trains.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Their trains, James?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Exactly—their trains or skirts. You
know how that it is not possible for you to be
in a crowd without having your skirts trodden
on and ripped out of the gathers. There
used to be a contrivance, Tryphœna, I remember
you had it once, like a pair of bell-ropes.
You put your fingers into rings, and
up came your train in a series of loops and
folds, on the principle of the Venetian blind.
But somehow you were always pulling up
your skirt just too late, after it had been be-trampled
and be-muddled. Now from what
I have observed, the skirts and trains of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>aristocracy are imbued with an imparted
vitality from their persons, for all the world
like the tail of a peacock, which it elevates
when it steps about in the dirt. Their skirts
shrink and rise of themselves, whenever a
rude foot approaches, or they tread where the
soil may bespatter.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, really, James—how can human
beings lift their tails?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear, I am speaking figuratively.
If you do not understand—remain in ignorance.
There is, as the clown says in ‘Twelfth
Night’ no darkness like ignorance. I suppose
you know, my dear, what it is to be
pressed upon and trampled on by those just
behind you in the social ball? Well, some
persons manage so cleverly that they do not
get their trains crumpled; and others are in
constant alarm and suspicion of everyone
who approaches within a pace of theirs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Welsh lighted a cigar.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t you mistake me and think that I
have given up my opinions. Nothing of the
sort. I notice the difference between the
aristocracy and ourselves, but I do not say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>that I do not estimate the middle class above
theirs. On the contrary, I think our order of
the nobility is the most honourable. To us
belongs the marquisate.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“James, how can you talk such nonsense?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is a fact, Tryphœna, that the marquis
or margrave takes, or rather took, his title
from the debatable ground he held. He was
the earl who watched the marches against the
barbarians; he protected civilisation from
overthrow. It was because he stood with
drawn sword on the confines, armed <i>cap-à-pie</i>,
that the counts and viscounts and the barons
sat in clover at home and grew fat and wanton.
We, Tryphœna, guard the marches, we occupy
the debatable ground, and we have to be perpetually
on the alert, to make blaze of beacons,
blow cow-horns, and rattle drums at the least
approach or signs of approach of barbarism.
Of course we are touchy, tenacious of our
right, sensitive about our skirts, and must
bluster and deal blows to protect them. We
hold the banat, the military frontier between
culture and savagery, and it is because of us
that the noblemen and gentlemen of England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>can dwell at home at ease. Of course our
hands are rough with grip of the lance and
sword, and our boots smell of the stable.
Heigh-ho!—here comes my Lady Fair—and
not looking herself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He stood up, and threw away his cigar
into the grate and then went to the window
and threw up the sash. Arminell entered in
her bonnet; her face was sad, and her eyes
were red as though she had been crying.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Inglett! I shall kill myself for having
lit a cigar,” said Welsh, “I am vexed
beyond measure. I did not think you were
going to favour us with your company. As
for Tryphœna, she loves smoke as a salamander
loves fire. But—what is the matter? You
remind me of a certain river I have read
about in Bohn’s translation of ‘Herodotus.’
The river flowed sweet from its source for
many miles, but finally a tiny rill of bitterness
entered it, and throughout the rest of its
course to the sea the waters had lost their
freshness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not so, Mr. Welsh,” said Arminell with
a smile. “At least, I trust not. May I not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>rather have reached the point to which the
tide mounts? It is not bitterness that is in
me, but just a smack of the salt of the mighty
far-off ocean that runs up the estuary of life,
and qualifies sooner or later the water of every
soul.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What has troubled you? I’m sure something
has gone wrong.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have been with Thomasine to see your
nephew.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What—Jingles! you should not have
done that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thomasine had paid a visit to Mrs.
Bankes, the landlady of the house where Mrs.
Saltren lodged before she married and departed;
and the good woman told the girl
something about Mr. Saltren that made me
uneasy. So I went to see him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have acted inconsiderately,” said
James Welsh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not say that it was a proper and
prudent thing to do, and yet, under the circumstances,
justifiable, and I have no doubt
you will forgive me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You must make a full confession before I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>pronounce the absolution,” said the journalist.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thomasine goes occasionally to see the
good woman of the lodgings and her servant,
and she heard so sad an account of your
nephew that she communicated it to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the matter with him? I have
not seen the cock-sparrow for three months,
and what is more, I do not want to see him;
I can never forgive him for what he has
done.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He knows how you regard him, and that
is the reason why he has not been to see you,
and told you how he was situated.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But what has happened? Has he been
run over at crossing? He is fool enough
for even that to befall him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, Mr. Welsh; I will tell you all I
know, and then you will think more kindly
and judge more leniently of Mr. Saltren.
The landlady spoke to Thomasine because
she was uneasy about him, and she is a
good-hearted creature. It seems that when
Mrs. Saltren married, Mr. Saltren was left
without any means whatever.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>“He had plenty of money. He sold
Chillacot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He made over the whole proceeds to his
mother. She has not left him a penny of it.
From what I learn, she has given it to
Captain Tubb to invest for her in a water-wheel
and a pump.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marianne is fool enough for anything—except
to speak the truth. What next?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“After she had departed as Mrs. Tubb,
your nephew was left absolutely without
resources. He did everything that lay in
his power to obtain a situation, first in one
capacity, then in another. He even—he
even”—Arminell’s voice quivered—“he
even offered himself as a shop assistant and
was rejected. Disappointments, repeated
day by day and week by week, told on his
spirits and on his health. As he was
without means, he frankly informed his
hostess about his circumstances, and asked
for leave to occupy an attic bedroom, promising
to pay her directly he got employment.
She did not like to turn him out, and I
daresay she thought she would get her rent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>in the end from Mrs. Tubb, so she consented.
But he has been living for many
weeks on nothing but bread and a little thin
tea without milk. He has sold his books
and everything he could part with, and is
now reduced to dire distress. He goes out
every day in the desperate endeavour to
find work, but his superior education, and
his gentlemanly feelings stand in his way.
Now his health is failing, he looks too delicate
for work, and no one will have him on
that account. He does not complain. He
goes on trying, but his daily disappointments
have broken his spirit. It does seem a
hopeless venture for a man of good education
and exceptional abilities to find work in
London.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sans interest,” added Welsh. “Of old,
interest was in the hands of the upper
classes. Now it is in the hands of the
lower.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I heard a good deal of this from Thomasine,”
continued Arminell. “I could not
bear it. I ran off to Bloomsbury to see Mrs.
Bankes, and found her to be a very kind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>feeling, and willing woman. She told me
everything—how underfed Mr. Saltren was,
how thin and shabby his clothes had become,
what a bad cough he had got, and
how long it was since she had been paid for
her lodging.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I made sure Mrs. Bankes would not omit
to mention that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She is a most considerate woman. She
said she had done him an egg of late, every
morning, and charged him nothing for it,
though eggs are at nine for a shilling, and he
had had sixteen in all; so that she was, as
she said, beside the cost of his lodging,
nearly two shillings to the bad through these
eggs—but she is a good honest soul, she
told me he had worn out the soles of his
boots and could not afford a new pair, and
they let in the wet.” Arminell stopped, she
was choking.</p>

<p class='c005'>Presently she went on, “Whilst we were
talking, he came in at the house door, and I
heard him cough; and then he went upstairs,
with his hand on the bannisters, dragging
his tired feet and his springless weight up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>the steep steps. He halted at each landing;
he was weary and his breath failed. I
listened till he had reached the very top of
the house, and gone into his little attic room
where he sleeps, and reads, and eats, and
dreams over his disappointments.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She stopped. She had clasped her hands
on her lap, and was twisting, plaiting, and
pulling her fingers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then you came away to tell me,” said
Mr. Welsh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I did not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What next?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My heart was full. I went out into the
lobby and stood there, and I began to cry.
And then, all at once, I ran upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What—to his room?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—I went after him, I could not help
it. He was so utterly lonely and so unhappy.
Mrs. Bankes said that no one ever came to
see him, he had no friends. It is dreadful to
think of being alone in London for months
without any one to speak to, that is, any one
who feels for you, and knows about persons
and things and places you have loved. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>ran upstairs after him, and tapped at his
door, and dashed right in on him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The colour rose and fell on her cheek.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should have been happy for the
occasion to have a talk with him, only the
circumstances were so sad. My heart came
into my throat when I saw him, and I held
out my hand to him—no, in honour bright—I
held out both hands to him. He was
surprised. I sat down there and made him
tell me everything. He did not complain,
he was very brave, but he had lost hope, and
he plodded on as in a treadmill, trying for
work because it was a duty to seek it, not
because he was sanguine of getting it. I do
not know how long I was there; I insisted
on having tea with him, and quite a nice little
tea we had, and a chop—no, two chops with
it. I ordered them, and I would have them,
and, of course, Mrs. Bankes brought up
Worcester sauce as well. Who ever knew
a lodging-house without Worcester sauce?
I am obstinate when I take an idea into my
head. You know that. He was quite happy,
I do believe, happier than he has been for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>months, sitting there with me, taking tea,
and milk in the tea, and talking about old
times, and Orleigh—dear Orleigh!—and my
brother Giles and papa.” Her heart was
beating fast, so fast that it stopped her flow of
words.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Welsh said nothing, nor did Mrs.
Welsh, who looked at her husband questioningly,
and then at Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Once or twice I made him laugh, and
the colour came again into his white face,
and the brightness into his dull eyes. But
when he laughed it brought on a fit of coughing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why did not the fellow come to me?”
asked Welsh. “I have no patience with his
pride—it was nothing but pride which kept
him away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Self-respect, perhaps, and resolve to
make a way for himself if possible. You had
discouraged him from attempting literature,
and he had lost all faith in politics. Besides,
he kept away from this house because
I was in it, and he felt he had no right to
come here whilst I lived with you.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>She began again to plait her fingers, and
looked down at them with a little confusion
in her face. Presently she looked at the
miniature of the marine officer, Mrs. Welsh’s
father, and said, with a laugh, “Do you know,
Mr. Welsh, that Mrs. Saltren imposed on
the landlady, and made her believe that she
was going to marry an Admiral of the Blue.
When Mrs. Bankes found out the truth,
Mrs. Saltren, I mean Mrs. Tubb, said she
had heard men-of-war so constantly spoken
of as tubs, and nothing but tubs, and as her
husband was a Tubb, she considered she had
a right to speak of him as a naval officer. It
is a shame to tell the story, but—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is too good not to be told. Marianne
all over.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And, Mr. Welsh, there was a doctor
lodging on the first floor at Mrs. Bankes’,
and he happened to see your nephew on the
stairs, and hear him cough, so he made him
step into his room and he examined his
chest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What did he say?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That there was constitutional delicacy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>and that unless he went for a couple of
winters to the south of Europe, and after that
wintered at Penzance, Torquay, or Bournemouth,
he would be a dead man. But, if he
took proper care of himself and lived well,
drank cod-liver oil and old port, kept out of
east winds and from getting wet, he might
yet make old bones.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is out of the question,” said Welsh;
“he shall have De Jongh’s cod-liver oil, and
inhale carbolic acid, and wear Dr. Jaeger’s
all-wool—to go to the south of Europe is impracticable.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not at all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear Miss Inglett, not another word.
I will do all I can for the rascal. But I cannot
afford that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I can.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I won’t allow it. I am very sorry for the
boy, and will do my duty by him as his uncle;
but I can’t send him to the Riviera.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But it is settled that he is going.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How? When?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Directly, and with me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nonsense, Miss Inglett.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>“And I have a house at Bournemouth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is true; but——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I’m going to marry him, so as to be
able to nurse him and carry him off to Bordighera,
and give him De Jongh’s cod-liver
oil myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Inglett, in reason!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is settled. I settled it. I have paid
Mrs. Bankes for the eggs and all the rest.
When we are off together we can talk at our
leisure about Orleigh.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>Sir Joshua Reynolds, in his treatise on the
composition of a picture, lays down as a
necessity that a patch of blue sky should be
introduced into every painting, an opening
through which the eye may escape out of the
constraint and gloom of the canvas. If the
subject be a dungeon, in one corner must be
a window through which the eye can mount
to heaven; if a forest, there must be a gap
in the foliage through which the sun may
strike and the free air blow. If a landscape
under a grey canopy, or a storm at sea under
rolling clouds, there must be a rift somewhere
through which the upper azure gleams;
otherwise the picture oppresses and the frame
cramps. For this reason, the preceding
chapter was entitled “A Patch of Blue Sky,”
for in that chapter a small opening was made
quite in a corner, into that serene and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>super-terrestrial, that ethereal and sublime realm—matrimony.</p>

<p class='c005'>For a good many chapters our hero and
heroine have been in a poor way, inhaling
London smoke, without sunshine enlivening
their existences. From Orleigh Park to
Shepherd’s Bush, and from the elastic atmosphere
of the country to the fogs of the
metropolis, is a change which, considering
the altered conditions of both—Jingles without
a situation, living on bread and thin tea,
and Arminell without a home, living with
third-rate people—was depressing to both,
and the picture was overcharged with
shadows. Therefore a little glimpse has
been given into that heaven to which all
youthful and inexperienced novel-readers
aspire.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sir Joshua Reynolds, moreover, insists on
a proper balance of lights and shadows. He
says that it is false art to accumulate dark
spots on one side of the picture without relieving
them with a corresponding number of
luminous foci on the other. Now in this
story the reader has been given three deaths.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Therefore, there must needs be the same
number of marriages to produce equilibrium.
Accordingly, over against the dark points of
Archelaus Tubb, Lord Lamerton, and Captain
Saltren, we set off the bright combinations
of Samuel and Joan, of Captain Tubb
and Marianne, and of Arminell and Jingles.
These are not, it is true, spots of transcendent
brilliancy, double stars of the first order, but
of subdued and chastened effulgence. Not
many roses crowned the hymeneal altar of
Sam Ceely, nor would an impassioned
epithalamium suit the nuptials of Mrs. Saltren,
just recovered from a touch of paralysis.
Nor will the beaker of ecstatic love brim over
at the union of Arminell and Giles Saltren,
seeing that it is largely filled with De Jongh’s
cod-liver oil. When a cook has over-salted
the soup, he mixes white sugar with it, and
this neutralises the brine and gives the soup
a mellowness, and velvety softness to the
palate. On the same principle, having put
too many tears into this tale, I am shaking
in the hymeneal sugar in just proportions.</p>

<p class='c005'>I know very well I am letting the reader
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>into the secrets of construction, telling the
tricks of the trade, but as this narrative is
written for instruction as well as for amusement,
I do not scruple thus to indicate one of
the principles of the art of novel writing;
and I do this with purpose, to gain the
favour of the reader, who I fear is a little
ruffled and resentful, because I do not give a
full and particular account of the marriage.
But it really hardly merited such an account,
it was celebrated so quietly—without choral
song and train of bride’s-maids, and without
peal of bells. I am so much afraid that by
omitting to make a point of the marriage I may
offend my readers that I have let them into
one of the secrets of the construction of a plot.</p>

<p class='c005'>Among poor people a bottle of lemon-drops
is set on the table, and the children are given
bread to eat. Those little ones whose conduct
has been indifferent are allowed only
bread and point for a meal, but those who
have behaved well are permitted to enjoy
bread and rub. To their imaginations some
of the sweetness of the lollipops penetrates
the glass and adheres to their slices.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>A novel is the intellectual meal of a good
many readers, and it begins with bread and
point, and is expected to end with bread and
rub at the acidulated drops of connubial
felicity. Usually the reader has to consume
a great deal of bread and point and is only
allowed bread and rub in final chapters. In
this story, however, I have been generous, I
have allowed of three little frettings at the
bottle instead—indeed, instead of keeping
one tantalising bottle before the eyes of the
reader, I have set three on the table in front
of him.</p>

<p class='c005'>That I have transgressed the rule which
requires the marriage of hero and heroine to
be at the end of the book, in the very last
chapter, I freely admit; but I have done this
on purpose, and I have, for the same purpose,
most slyly slipped in the marriage, or rather
left it to the imagination, between the end of
Chapter LI. and the beginning of Chapter
LII. And what do you suppose is my
reason? It is, that I want to <i>dodge the
dippers</i>. The dippers are those readers who
are only by an euphemism called readers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>They stand by the course of a story, and pop
a beak down into it every now and then, and
bring up something from the current, and
then fly away pretending that they have read
the whole story. The dipper generally
plunges the bill into the first chapter, then
dips into the last of the three volumes, and
then again once or twice in the mid-stream of
the tale.</p>

<p class='c005'>These dippers are gorgeous creatures,
arrayed in gold and azure, with bejewelled
necks and wings and crowns. But in one
matter they differ from all other fowl—they
have no gizzards. Other birds, notably
those of the barn door, when they eat pass
their food through a pair of internal grindstones,
and thoroughly digest and assimilate
it. The dippers, being devoid of this organ,
neither digest nor assimilate anything. They
take nothing into them for the purpose of
nutrition, but for the taste it leaves on their
tongues. Consequently, the food they like
best is not that which invigorates, but that
which is high flavoured.</p>

<p class='c005'>A dipper may seem very small game at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>which to fire, a shot, but the dippers are the
special aversion of novel writers. These
latter have laboured to please, perhaps to
instruct; they have worked with their pens
till their fingers are cramped, and their
brains bemuzzed, and they see the fruit of
conscientious toil treated as a bird treats a
nectarine—pecked at and spoiled, not eaten.</p>

<p class='c005'>But I have headed this chapter “On
Dippers,” not because I intended to blaze at
those little, frivolous, foolish birds who dip
into my story and let all they scoop up
dribble from their beaks again, but because
I have another class of dippers in my eye,
about whom I have still sharper words to
say. And see!—one of this order has unexpectedly
dropped in on the Welshes—and
that is Mrs. Cribbage.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Reverend Mrs. Cribbage was not one
of the king-fishers, but was a dipper of the
cormorant or skua genus. She was not one
to stand by the stream of a story and dip in
that, but in the sea of life, and seek in that
for savoury meat over which to snap the bill,
and smack the tongue, and turn up the eyes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>and distend the jaw-pouches. The dippers
of this order congregate on a rock above the
crystal tide and chatter with their beaks,
whilst their eyes pierce the liquid depths.
They have no perceptions of the beauty of
colour in the water, no admiration for its
limpidity. They inhale with relish none of
the ozone that wafts over it—their eyes
explore for blubber, for uprooted weed, for
mollusks that have been bruised, for dead
fish, for crustaceans that have lost limbs,
for empty shells invaded by parasites, for
the scum, and the waste, and the wreckage,
in the mighty storm-tossed ocean of
life.</p>

<p class='c005'>Aristotle, in his “History of Animals,”
says that most fish avoid what is putrescent;
but the taste of the dippers is other than that
of the fish. The dippers have no perception
and liking for the freshness and fragrance of
the sea, but have vastly keen noses for
carrion. The suffering whiting, the crushed
nautilus, the disabled shrimp, are pounced on
with avidity, and the great penguin-pouch
expands under the beak like a Gladstone bag
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>full of the most varied forms of misery, of
sorrow and of nastiness.</p>

<p class='c005'>The skua is a dipper akin to, but more
active than the wary cormorant and the
clumsy auk. It is a lively bird, and darts on
nimble wing over the sea, and when it perceives
a glutted dipper in flight, it dives
under it, strikes it on the breast, and makes
it disgorge; whereupon it seizes the prey as
it falls, for itself. There are skuas as well
as cormorants about the coasts of the great
social ocean, and there are birds with the
voracity of the cormorant and the quickness
and adroitness of the skua—of such was Mrs.
Cribbage. It was part of her cleverness in
getting the food she required to come with a
whisk and blow at those who least expected
her; and such was her visit or swoop on the
Welshes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Unfortunately for her, James Welsh was
at home when she swept in, and he was quite
able to hold his own before her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear,” said he to his wife, “I think I
hear the cook squealing. She is in an
epileptic fit. You had better go down into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>the kitchen and remain below as long as the
fit lasts. Get the slavey to sit on her feet,
and you hold her head. I will remain at the
service of Mrs. Cribbage. I am sure she
will excuse you. We have an epileptic
cook, ma’am—not a bad cook when out of
her fits.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am Mrs. Cribbage,” said the visitor,
“the wife of the Rector of Orleigh. We
have not had the pleasure of meeting before,
but I know your sister, Mrs. Tubb, very well;
she is a parishioner and the wife of one of our
Sunday-school teachers. Of course I know
about you, Mr. Welsh, though you may not
know me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have heard a good deal about you,
ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Through whom?” asked the lady eagerly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Through my nephew.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have come to break to you some sad
news about your sister. Poor thing, she had
a first seizure on the death of her first husband,
and she had a second immediately after
her return to Orleigh as a bride. It was kept
quiet. I was not told of it, nor was my husband
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>sent for. Now a third has ensued which
has bereft her of speech, and it is feared will
end fatally. I have come to town for some
purchases and on a visit to friends, and I
thought it would be kind and wise if I came
to see you and tell you what I knew.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very kind indeed, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I promised Captain Tubb that I would
do so; he is not a great hand at letter writing,
and I said that I could explain the circumstances
so much better by word of mouth
than he could with the pen. The case, I fear,
is serious. She cannot speak.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It must indeed be serious, if Marianne
can’t speak,” observed Welsh dryly; “I’ll
run down to Orleigh to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How is your nephew? Mrs. Tubb hadn’t
heard of him for three or four months. I dare
say anxiety about him has brought on the
seizure.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My late nephew?” Welsh heaved a sigh.
“Poor fellow, he is gone. He always was
delicate.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gone!—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—to a warm place.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>“It is not for us to judge,” said Mrs.
Cribbage, sternly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, perhaps not,” answered Welsh;
“but between you and me, ma’am, for what
else was he fit?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I always considered that he gave himself
airs, and I had an impression that he indulged
in free-thinking. Still, he was not positively
vicious. Nothing was proved against his
morals.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Others go to a warm place that shall be
nameless, besides those who are positively
vicious.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Mrs. Cribbage, “that is true,
sadly true. And now to change the topic—how
is Miss Inglett? Is she still with you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Inglett?” Welsh’s eyes twinkled.
He knew what the woman had come to his
place for. It was not out of kindness to
communicate to him his sister’s condition.
He felt the dig of the skua’s beak in his chest.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh yes, we know all about it. Marianne
Tubb talked before she had the stroke and
lost the power of speech. You must not suppose,
Mr. Welsh, that we are taken in and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>believe that the Honourable Arminell Inglett
died as has been represented, through the
shock caused by her father’s fatal fall.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah! I remember seeing something about
it in the papers. She died, did she?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, no, Mr. Welsh, that will not do. Your
sister let the cat out of the bag. She said
that Miss Inglett was lodging here with you;
and very boastful Mr. Tubb was about it, and
much talk did it occasion in Orleigh. Some
people would not believe it, they said that
Marianne Saltren had been a liar, and Marianne
Tubb was no better. However, others
say that there is something in it. So, as I
am come to town, I thought I would just run
here and inquire, and see Miss Inglett myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We have had an Inglett here, certainly,”
answered Welsh composedly, “and very decent
pastry she made. She had a light
hand.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not comprehend.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you in want of a cook, a nursemaid,
or parlour maid? She was a handy girl,
and Mrs. Welsh would be happy to give her
a good character—a true and honest one, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>reading between the lines, no disguising of
defects. She did not drink, was not a lie-abed,
and was clean in her work and person.
I won’t say whether she put her fingers into
the sugar, because I don’t know, and Mrs.
Welsh keeps the preserves and candied fruit
locked up in the side-board.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not understand,” said Mrs. Cribbage,
gazing perplexedly at Mr. Welsh’s imperturbable
face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“She was a sort of general hand with us,”
explained Welsh, “was that girl Inglett.
We were sorry to lose her, but she thought
to better herself, and we do not give high
wages. We can’t afford to pay more than
twelve pounds, and no beer. But the maid
has the tea-leaves and dripping. That is—she
had; but now that we have a cook, the
cook arrogates the dripping to herself. We
bear the young woman no grudge for leaving
us. It is the way with girls, they will always
be on the move, and if they can better themselves
by moving, why not? What wages
do you pay, ma’am? And how about perquisites?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>“You had a general servant named Inglett?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, and our present housemaid is named
Budge. Our cook is Mrs. Winter. The
last cook we had drank, and ran up a ladder.
It took several policemen to get her down.
The ladder was of extraordinary height. It
stood in a builder’s yard. It was impossible
for us to retain the woman after that. She
had risen into notoriety. Then, for awhile,
the girl Inglett cooked for us; she was not
brought up to it, had never passed through
her apprenticeship as kitchen-maid, but some
women take to cooking as poets take to
verses—naturally.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is true,” said Mrs. Cribbage. Her
mouth was gradually falling at the corners.
She had expected to fish up a very queer
and unpleasant bit of scandal, and, to her
disappointment, began to see that she had
spooned up clean water in her beak.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mrs. Welsh, seeing her abilities, may
have advised the girl Inglett to take a
kitchen-maid’s place—I cannot say. Has
she applied to you for such a situation in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>your house, ma’am? If so, I am sure Mrs.
Welsh can confidently recommend her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We thought,” said Mrs. Cribbage, in a
tone of discouragement, “that is to say, Mrs.
Tubb said most positively that—that the
Honourable Arminell Inglett, daughter of
Lord Lamerton, was not dead, but was lodging
with you. And you <i>really</i> had a servant
of the name of Inglett?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly, a general, as I said—and now
you mention it, it does seem queer that she
should have had such an aristocratic name,
but I daresay she assumed it, as actresses
do.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was led by Marianne Tubb to suppose—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Was not that like Marianne?” Mr.
Welsh went into a fit of laughter. Mrs.
Cribbage, with a ghastly smile, admitted that
it was like Marianne Tubb, who was certainly
given to boasting and romancing.
However, she added, charitably—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Really, it almost seems a judgment on
her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What does?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>“The stroke. It was too bad of her to
make us suppose that the Honourable Arminell
Inglett had come to live in such a
quarter as this. Then you really believe,
Mr. Welsh, that Lord Lamerton’s daughter
died of the shock, when she heard of her
father’s premature death?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I saw it so stated in the papers, and
they are generally well informed. What sort
of a person was she? I ask you, as the
Rector’s wife, was she worldly? Was she at
all prepared for the great change?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Cribbage shook her head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was afraid it was so,” said Welsh
solemnly. “Then I should not be at all
surprised if she also had gone to the same
warm place as my poor nephew.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is not for us to judge,” said Mrs.
Cribbage gravely; “still, if it be permitted
us to look beyond the veil, I would not say
but that she had. She was barely civil to
me, once she was positively rude. Yes—I
have no doubt that she also has gone—gone—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To the same warm place,” added Welsh.</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>Having occupied an entire chapter with
dippers, it may seem to the reader to be acting
in excess of what is just to revert in the
ensuing chapter to the same topic; but if we
mention dippers again, it is in another sense
altogether.</p>

<p class='c005'>In an oriental tale, a sultan was unable to
conceive how that a thousand days could
seem to pass as a minute, or a minute be expanded
into a thousand days. Then a
magician bade a pail of water be brought into
the royal presence, and invited the sultan to
plunge his head into it. He did so, and at
once found himself translated to a strange
country where he was destitute of means of
life, and was forced to support existence by
hard labour as a porter. He married a wife,
and became the father of seven children, after
which his wife died, and as he was oppressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>with old age and poverty, he plunged into a
river to finish his woes, when—up came his
head out of the pail of water. He stormed
at the magician for having given him such a
life of wretchedness. “But, sire,” said the
magician, “your august head has been under
water precisely three seconds.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now I do not mean to say that this story
is applicable to my hero and heroine in all its
parts. I do not mean that their history and
that of the sultan fit, when one is applied to
the other, as to the triangles <span class='fss'>A B C</span> and <span class='fss'>D E F</span>
in the fourth proposition of the First Book of
Euclid, but only that there is a resemblance.
Both Giles Saltren and Arminell had, as the
expression goes, got their heads under water,
and having got them there, found themselves
beginning a new career, in a fresh place of
existence, with fresh experiences to make
and connections to form. The past was to
both cut away as if it had never been, and,
unlike this sultan, there was no prospect of
their getting their heads up again into their
former life. They must, therefore, make the
best they could of that new life in which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>found themselves; and, perhaps, Arminell
acted sensibly in resolving that they should
begin it together.</p>

<p class='c005'>If Arminell had settled into her house at
Bournemouth, and kept her pony-carriage,
and appeared to be unstraitened in circumstances,
the residents of Bournemouth would,
in all probability, have asked who this Miss
Inglett was, and have turned up the name in
the Red Books, and pushed enquiries which
could with difficulty have been evaded; but
when she set up her establishment as Mrs.
Saltren the case was altered; for the patronymic
does not occur in the “Peerage” or
in “Burke’s Landed Gentry.” It was a
name to baffle enquiry, whereas Inglett was
calculated to provoke it. It is true that
Arminell might have changed her maiden
name without altering her condition, but this
she was reluctant to do.</p>

<p class='c005'>In Gervase of Tilbury’s “Otia Imperalia”
is an account of a remarkable event that took
place in England in the reign of Henry II.
One day an anchor descended out of the
clouds and grappled the earth, immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>followed by a man who swarmed down the
cable and disengaged the anchor, whereupon
man and anchor were drawn up again into
the clouds.</p>

<p class='c005'>Similar events occur at the present day.
People, not men alone, but women, whole
families, come down on us out of the clouds,
and move about on the earth in our midst.</p>

<p class='c005'>We know neither whence they come, nor
anything about their antecedents. They talk
and eat and drink like the rest of us, and are
sometimes very agreeable to converse with,
and take infinite pains to make themselves
popular. Nevertheless, we regard them with
suspicion. We are never sure that they will
be with us long. Some day they will release
the anchor and go up with a whisk above the
clouds into the fog-land whence they fell.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are certain times of the year when
meteoric stones descend, and there are certain
belts on the surface of the earth on which
they chiefly tumble. So is it with these
people who come down on us out of the
clouds. They usually fall into watering-places,
and winter-quarters, and always drop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>down in the season at these resorts. Rarely
do they descend into quiet country towns or
rural districts among the autochthones, parsonic
and squirarchical. We come on them
abroad, we become acquaintances, we sit together
at the opera, organize picnics together,
take coffee at one table in the gardens where
the band plays, yet we never know whence
they have come and whither they will go.
When we are at the sea-side with our family
we meet with another family, the father and
mother respectable, the young men handsome
and polite, the girls æsthetic, and with—oh,
such eyes! The young people soon strike
up an intimacy, go boating, shrimping, nutting
together; but we, the parents, have
seen the intimacy thicken with some uneasiness,
and do not like to see our son hang
about the handsomest of the girls, or the
most irreproachable of the young men so
assiduous in his attentions to our daughter.
Then we begin to institute enquiries, but
learn nothing. Nobody ever heard of these
people before. Nobody ever saw them
before. Nobody knows where they made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>their money—yet money they must have, for
the girls dress charmingly, and you cannot
dress charmingly by the sea-side for nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, all at once, when these people become
aware that you are pushing enquiries,
the blade of the anchor wriggles out of the
sand, and up they all go, the young men
waving their straw hats, and the girls casting
sad glances out of their splendid eyes, and
the old people silent about prosecuting the
acquaintance elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c005'>But—it must be admitted that these people
who come down out of the clouds do not for
the most part form as complete a family as
that just spoken of. Either the monsieur or
the madame is deficient, and we never know
exactly where he or she is, whether above
the clouds or under the earth.</p>

<p class='c005'>No doubt that at Bournemouth, as at other
sea-side places, persons appear at the beginning
of the season, cast anchor for a while,
and no one troubles himself about their
antecedents, because they are supposed to be
there for the season only; but were a young
lady to anchor herself firmly, to buy a house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>and become a permanent resident, especially
if she were pretty and rich, do you suppose
that the Bournemouth residents would not
examine the cable of her anchor, to see if the
government thread be woven into it, and the
anchor to discover the maker’s stamp? Do
you not suppose that they would set their
telescopes and opera-glasses to work to discover
out of what star the rope descended?</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell knew this. She brought with her
out of her old world that caution which bade
her inquire who a person was before she consulted
with that person; and she was quite
sure that wherever she set up her tent, there
questions would be asked concerning her.
She knew that there were Mrs. Cribbages
everywhere, and that she would have to be
on her guard against them. But her difficulties
about keeping her secret were materially
diminished by marriage.</p>

<p class='c005'>The ceremony took place quietly, and no
announcement of it was made in the <i>Times</i>,
the <i>Queen</i>, and the country papers. Immediately
after it, she and Giles departed for
Algiers. That was the warm place of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Mr. Welsh had spoken to Mrs. Cribbage.
They went to Algiers, instead of Bordighera
and Mentone, because Saltren had been to
the Riviera before, and might be recognised.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell had constituted herself the nurse
of Jingles. She was the nurse not only of a
sick body, but of an infirm soul. His morbid
sensitiveness was in part constitutional, and
due to his delicacy, but it had been fostered
and been ripened by the falseness of the
position in which he had been placed.
Arminell had recovered her elasticity sooner
than had he; but then she had not been reduced
to the same distress. Both had been
humbled, but the humiliations he had undergone
had been more numerous, more persistent
than hers. She, at her moral rebound,
had adapted herself to her situation and had
done well in every capacity; he had not been
able to find any situation in which he could
show his powers.</p>

<p class='c005'>The body reacts on the moral nature more
than we suppose, or allow for in others. We
call those ill-tempered who are in fact disordered
in liver and not in heart, and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>consider those to be peppery who in reality
are only irritable because they have gout
flying about their joints. The morbidness of
Jingles was largely due to his delicacy of
lung, and with De Jongh’s cod-liver oil would
probably in time disappear.</p>

<p class='c005'>When a man battles a way for himself into
a position not his by right of birth, he
acquires a tough skin. Siegfried, the Dragon-slayer,
goes by the name of the Horny
Siegfried because, by bathing in the dragon’s
blood, he toughened his hide—only between
his shoulders, where a linden-leaf fell whilst
he was bathing, could he be made to feel.</p>

<p class='c005'>The successful men who have fought
dragons and captured their guarded treasures
are thick-skinned, impervious to hints, ridicule,
remonstrances—you cannot pinch them,
scratch them, prick them, unless you discover
the one vulnerable point. But Saltren had
fought no dragons, only his own shadow, and
his skin was as thin as the inner film of an egg—highly
sensitive, and puckering at a breath.
His vanity had been broken away, but his
skin had not been rendered more callous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>thereby. Formerly he was in perpetual
dudgeon because he imagined slights that
were never offered. He still imagined
slights, but instead of becoming angry at
them became depressed.</p>

<p class='c005'>As his health improved in the dry,
salubrious air of North Africa, he began to
interest himself in the antiquities, to explore
ruins, to copy inscriptions, and so forgot himself
in archæological pursuits. Arminell
encouraged him to prosecute these subjects,
and he became more enthusiastic on them;
he regretted that the increasing heat would
send him to Europe. However, on his arrival
at Bournemouth, he found occupation in arranging
his library and setting out his antiquities.
Then he wrote an account of some explorations
he had among the megalithic monuments
near Constantine for a scientific journal,
and this attracted attention, and led to correspondence,
and to the article being reprinted
with additions, and to a dispute as to the
resemblances and dissimilarities between the
Constantine monuments and the so-called
Druidical remains in Britain.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>The following winter Saltren was again at
Algiers, and resumed his explorations with
assiduity, spent much time in planning,
sketching, digging, and formed a theory of
his own relative to megalithic monuments
contrary to that of Mr. Fergusson, whom he
resolved to attack and crush. When summer
came, at his particular desire, Arminell and
he visited Denmark and Norway, where he
examined such stone monuments as belonged
to a prehistoric period, and then went with
her into Brittany.</p>

<p class='c005'>As he became known as an antiquary, his
society was sought by men of like tastes, and
so he came to have a little circle of acquaintances,
which tended to widen, and as those
who came to know him through prehistoric
rude stone monuments fell in love with his
charming young wife, they insisted on their
womankind calling and knowing her also.
In vain did the ladies ask, “But, who was
she?” They were crushed with the reply,
“My dears, what does it matter what she
<i>was</i>, she <i>is</i> the wife of one of our first
authorities on comparative megalithology.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>So by degrees, the young couple formed a
coterie about themselves, and were no longer
solitary and feeling as if they were outcasts.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now and then Mr. Welsh ran down to
Bournemouth and spent a day with them,
and sometimes Mrs. Welsh brought the
baby; but the Welshes were no assistance to
them in social matters. The Welsh circle
was of a different style of mind and manner
and interest from that which formed round
the Saltrens. It was not a circle which could
wax excited over anything prehistoric, it was
so completely engrossed in the present.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the Welshes were always received with
the utmost warmth and kindness by Arminell,
who could not forget what she owed them,
and harboured for the Radical journalist an
affection quite special, mixed with great
respect. She knew the thorough goodness
of the man, and she delighted in his smartness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here, Tryphœna,” said James
Welsh one day to his wife; “do you remember
what I said to you about aristocrats and
their trains? There is something else I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>tell you. Once upon a time, say the Mussulmans,
Allah, sitting on his throne in paradise,
dropped the slipper off his foot, and it fell
down into hell. Then he called to Adam,
and bade him go and fetch it. ‘What!’
exclaimed Adam, ‘Shall I, who am made in
the likeness of God, descend to the place
of devils? God forbid!’ Then Allah
ordered Abraham to go after his slipper.
‘Shall I go down into hell? I who am the
friend of God! Far be it from me!’ was
his reply. Then Allah turned to Moses,
and he exclaimed, ‘What! shall I, who am the
law-giver of God, I who led the people out of
the brick-kilns, shall I descend to the furnace?
Away with the thought!’ And David cried,
when Allah turned to him, ‘Nay, but I am
the psalmist of God, press me not to go where
demons yell discords.’ And Isaiah had also
an objection to go, for he said, ‘I am the
prophet of God.’ Then Allah turned to
Mahomet, and said, ‘Wilt thou go after my
slipper?’ And Mahomet answered, ‘I go
at once, I am the servant of God.’ Whereupon
Allah exclaimed, ‘Thou only art worthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>to sit on my throne. All the rest are a
parcel of cads’—or words to that effect.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, James, what has this to do with the
aristocracy?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Be silent, Tryphœna, and listen. You
and I and all those who have clambered up
the steps of the social heaven, are mightily
tenacious of our places, and resent the
slightest suggestion made to us to step below.
We clutch at our seats, and insist on
every prerogative and privilege that attaches
to it. Quite right that it should be so. We
value the place we have gained, because it
has cost us so much effort to attain it, and
because we have to balance ourselves and
cling so tight to keep ourselves from sliding
down. But it is different with those who
have been born and brought up on the footstool
of the throne. They don’t want a pat
of cobblers’-wax to keep them firm on their
seat, and they are not scrupulous about descending
after Allah’s shoe wherever it may
have fallen. If they go down to hell they don’t
get smoked. They don’t find anyone disputing
their seats when they return. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>can go and come, and we must sit and cling.
That makes a difference. There is something
of Allah everywhere, only it wants
fetching up. Just see what has been made
of that girl, Thomasine Kite. If ever there
was a wilful, unruly creature, fated to go to
the devil, it was she. And what could you
do with her? Nothing. You sat on a step
just above her, and were not able to stoop
for fear of toppling over. She is not the
same girl now, and I hear she is going to be
married to a sergeant of the coastguard.
She is a well-conducted woman, passionately
attached to her mistress, and no wonder,—Arminell
has brought up Allah’s slipper out
of her. Look again at Jingles! I never
had any opinion of him—a conceited, morbid
monkey—and I could have done nothing
with him; I lack the tact or whatever it is
that is needful. But he is changed also, unobtrusive,
self-respecting, learned, and modest—she
has brought up Allah’s slipper out of
him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are a weather-cock, James. At one
time you were all against the aristocracy, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>now no one can do anything right unless he
has blue blood in him. And yet—you call
yourself a Radical.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So I am—a Radical still,” said Welsh.
“I have not altered my opinions, but my
mode of procedure. I do not want to pull
the aristocracy down, but to pull all society
up to it. I don’t say that no one can fetch
up Allah’s slipper but a born gentleman, but
I do say that no one who has not attained to
the aristocratic ease in a superior position,
is likely to descend to seek Allah’s slipper,
wherever it is to be found. I may have been
wrong in thinking the best way of advancing
society was by pinching the calves of those
who sat above me, so as to make their seat
intolerable, instead of lending a hand to help
up those below to a share of my stool. Do
you understand me, old woman?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not think I do. You have such a
figurative method of speaking, James.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER LIV.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>MEGALITHIC.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>One bright summer day, when the sea was
still and blue as the nemophyla, and twinkling
as if strewn with diamond dust, Arminell
was in her garden, with an apron on,
gloves over her hands, a basket on her arm,
and scissors for flowers.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the end of the garden, partly screened
by rhododendrons, was a summer-house, and
outside it some lumps of plaster of Paris,
pots of oil-paint, and slabs of slate, smeared
with mortar. Occasionally the door of the
pavilion opened, and a man issued from it
wearing a brown-holland blouse, and on his
head a paper cap. Particles and splashes of
plaster marked his face, especially about the
nose, where he had rubbed with a white
finger.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will have it all cleaned away, Giles,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>said Arminell. “How are you getting on
with the models?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, only the plaster does not set
as fast as I could wish. When I have got
the dolmens of Gozo and Constantine, of
Lock Mariaker and Madron to scale, side by
side, the most prejudiced persons must agree
that the similarity of construction is strong
evidence of identity of origin. I can show
on my map of megalithic monuments where
the stream of dolmen builders travelled, how
that it set from Asia, along the margin of the
Baltic, and then branched north over Britain,
and south over Gaul. I can prove conclusively
that they were not Gauls and Kelts.
Just come and look at my cromlechs and
dolmens in the rough. The resemblance
<i>saute aux yeux</i>. We must establish their
geographical distribution, and then compare
their points of similarity and dis——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please, ma’am, a lady and a young
gentleman are in the drawing-room, and
want to see you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What names?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They gave none, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Arminell removed her apron, took off her
gloves, and handed them and the basket to
the maid, then went towards the drawing-room
glass door opening upon the garden.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Some people come to collect for the
Jubilee,” said Arminell aside to her husband,
as she passed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I heard they were about.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In another moment, however, Saltren,
who was engaged on his models of prehistoric
rude stone monuments, heard a cry,
and returning to the door of his laboratory,
saw Arminell in the arms of an old lady, and
at the same moment recognised her, and also
the boy at her side. Then, without removing
his blouse or his paper cap, he ran also
across the garden, to welcome Lady Lamerton
and his old pupil, Giles.</p>

<p class='c005'>I do not think I could better illustrate the
fact of the transformation that had been
effected in Jingles, than by mentioning this
incident. Can you—I cannot—conceive of
Mr. Jingles as tutor at Orleigh Park, allowing
himself to be seen smudged with plaster,
in a paper cap, with a nose of chalky whiteness?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>On the present occasion he was so
excited, so pleased to see dear Lady Lamerton
and Giles again, that he forgot all about
his own personal appearance, and even about
the quoit of the Madron cromlech he was then
modelling to scale.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton had come to see Arminell,
as Arminell could not visit her; and this was
her first visit. She had not ventured before,
because she did not think it prudent, not because
her heart did not draw her to Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>The most contradictory reports had circulated
relative to the girl. Some had asserted
that she was dead, others declared she was
alive. Then it was said she was lodging in
London, under an assumed name, and had
made herself notorious by her advocacy of
woman’s rights, divided skirts, and social
democracy. It was asserted that she had become
a platform orator and a writer under the
direction of that revolutionist, James Welsh.
This was again denied, and said to rest on a
mistake arising from James Welsh having had
a general servant named Inglett. After a
twelvemonth gossip ceased, for interest was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>no longer taken in a person who was no more
seen, and who probably was dead.</p>

<p class='c005'>And what does it matter, argued the
cynical, whether she be dead or alive, as she
is no more in society? We know nothing of
those who do not appear, who have not been
presented, who are not danced before our
eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>In mediæval times there were <i>oubliettes</i> in
all castles, and inconvenient persons were let
fall down them to disappear for ever. Did
they break their necks in falling? Or did
they linger on, fed on bread and water, and
languish for years? What did it matter?</p>

<p class='c005'>They were practically dead when the trap-door
closed over their heads.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every aristocratic, every gentle family has
now what was anciently the prerogative of the
mightiest barons only. Every family is encumbered
with its awkward and troublesome
members who must be dropped somewhere.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Honourable Arminell Inglett had gone
down an <i>oubliette</i>, but whether it were the
family vault or a social limbo mattered nothing.
We are too wise to ask about her.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>We never do anything inconsistent with good
taste. We let sleeping dogs lie, and don’t
push inquiries about dropped relatives.</p>

<p class='c005'>When we are invited to dine at my lord’s,
we do not peep to see if the broken meats and
half-finished bottles be tumbled down under
the feet to be mumbled and drained by the
forgotten ones beneath. When we dance at
my lady’s Christmas ball, in the state ballroom,
we know very well that below it is the
family <i>oubliette</i>, but we scuffle with our feet
to drown the moans of those <i>mauvais sujets</i>
who lie below, and the orchestra sounds its
loudest strain to disguise the rattle of their
chains.</p>

<hr class='c006' />

<p class='c005'>“My dear husband,” said Arminell, “take
Lamerton to see your models. They will
interest him, and I will go in with mamma.
Besides, you can clear his mind of delusions
with respect to the Druids, which is really
important. You know that there is a circle of
stones on Orleigh Common, and in an unguarded
moment the boy might attribute them
to the ancient Britons.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>“The matter is not one to joke upon,” said
Jingles with a flicker of annoyance in his face.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he retreated to the pavilion with his
old pupil, to show him the work on which he
was engaged.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell, quick in perception, saw that
Lady Lamerton had noticed the transient
cloud, so she said, with a smile, “Do you
remember my husband when he was Giles’s
tutor? I mean, do you remember how sensitive
he then was, how he winced when you
came near him? I have heard of nervous
disorders that make men thus susceptible.
If you put a finger on them, they scream and
writhe; if near them, they quiver with apprehension.
He was in like manner touchy.
Now, however, he is quite recovered. There
is but one single point on which he is sensitive,
and where a feather will make him
wince.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Megalithic monuments.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Megalithic monuments, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, mamma. He loves me dearly, but
even I, who can do almost anything with him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>would shrink from holding Mr. Fergusson’s
view that Stonehenge was a work of the
Anglo-Saxons. If it did not separate us, it
would make a temporary estrangement. But,
understand me, we are the greatest of friends,
we never quarrel. I believe with all my soul
that the rude stone monuments are prehistoric
and pre-Keltic.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And what are his political views?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not think he has any. But he is
deeply interested in the bill for the acquisition
and nationalisation of the antiquities of the
country. He says, and I agree with him,
that if Britain is to maintain her place as a
leading nation in the civilized world, she
should conserve most strictly every prehistoric
monument on the soil.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Arminell made Lady Lamerton rest
on the sofa; and she drew a stool to her feet,
and sat there holding her hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I dare say you cannot understand why I
married him,” she said, after a short period of
silence and mutual endearments. “But I was
much alone, and oh! so solitary. I wanted
a companion and did not relish the idea of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>elderly eligible female, who, with bland perpetual
smile, acquiescence in all my vagaries,
non-resistance to my opinion, would have
been intolerable to me. I could not do without
a companion, and I could not endure the
society of one. It is the vocation of these
companions to be complaisant, to have no
view, no opinion, no personality. Unless she
were all that, she would be no companion; if
she were all that, she would be insupportable
to me. Then—with her I could not have
talked about dear Orleigh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She stroked and then kissed her step-mother’s
hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Also poor Jingles—I mean Mr. Saltren—required
a companion, a nurse; some one to
look after him day and night, and see that he
changed his socks when they were damp, and
drank fresh milk warm from the cow, and
took tonics at regular hours, and had sweet-oil
rubbed into his back between the shoulder-blades.
I could not ask Mrs. Bankes to do
that, or the housemaid, and there was really
no one else who could be asked. I could not
do this unless I married him, and so—I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>became his wife, and rubbed in the sweet-oil.
Thank God, he is a strong man now; but he
has to be kept up to the mark. I go with
him when he makes archæological excursions
to the Morbihan, or to Scotland to plan old
stones, for when he gets interested he forgets
himself, and would work on in an east wind
or in a sou’-west drizzle unless I were by to
insist on his postponing the measurements
till the weather mends. He is a dear,
amiable fellow, and yields with the best grace.
It is real pleasure to have to do with him.
Now tell me something about Orleigh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“About the people?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O yes, mamma, about the dear people
there.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know that Sam Ceely is married to
Joan Melhuish, and she is devoted to that
old impostor as you seem to be to your
patient. They live now in the cottage which
was occupied by Captain Tubb till he moved
to the old quarry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where is Patience Kite?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She has been had up twice before the
magistrates for obtaining money under false
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>pretences. She is an inveterate witch, and
might well have been left alone, but Mrs.
Cribbage has taken a dislike to her, and set the
police upon her, and has had her summonsed.
Just now she is in prison, because she could
not pay the fine imposed on her. How is
her daughter, Thomasine?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thomasine!—I will ring and you shall
see her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not just yet, Arminell.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, presently. She is the belle of
Bournemouth. Such a handsome girl,
blooms into greater beauty than ever, and
is so good and affectionate and steady. She
is going to be married to a coast-guard man,
a most respectable fellow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And now about yourself, Armie. Does
time not hang heavy on your hands? You
cannot be always engaged in prehistoric
antiquities.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed, mamma,” answered Arminell
with energy, “time does not hang heavy on
my hands. I have, of course, my dear
husband to consider first of all, but I have
plenty to occupy me besides—duties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>thoroughly humdrum. I visit the old women, I
read to the sick, I am an active patroness of
the Girls’ Friendly Society, and I teach every
Sunday in the school.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You do! Why, Armie, you used to
hate Sunday School.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dear mamma, I wish you could hear my
class of girls, they have just acquired the list
of apocryphal books which are not to be
applied to establish doctrine. And, till I find
some positive truth to teach, I content myself
with making them repeat the names of all
the homilies which no one has read, and
which never are likely to be read. They
have also been taught the meaning of
Quinquagesima, Sexagesima, and Septuagesima.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you think you are really doing good,
Armie?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am using all my energies to teach my
girls to grow up humdrum women.”</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
